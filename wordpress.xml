      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 class="text-align-center">Danielsaurus is about children, society, and other stuff.</h1><h3 class="text-align-center">And sometimes dinosaurs. Because who doesn't like dinosaurs?</h3><p>The whole kit-and-kaboodle is written by me, Daniel Bigler. I live in the Pacific Northwest, and I am a writer, teacher, and researcher who studies children's lives and issues.&nbsp;Sadly, I am also not a dinosaur. See?</p>

I spent more than a year there conducting an ethnography  during graduate school – and eventually I wrote a very long dissertation about it. (It was pretty great.)"/>
  

<h3 class="text-align-center">Oh, that's nice.&nbsp;Wait, who did you say you were again?</h3><p>I'm Daniel. (Hi.)&nbsp;By day, I teach &nbsp;whipper-snapper university students as a faculty member in the&nbsp;interdisciplinary field of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_studies">Children’s &amp; Childhood Studies</a>. It's kinda an awesome thing.</p><p>By night, I rule the skies, looking for bats. Because I'm Batman.&nbsp;I also like to make interesting things, read interesting words, and (occasionally) write interesting thoughts – and sometimes I go bowling.</p><p><em>Other things that I've done, in no particular order:</em></p><ul><li>Worked as a teacher in a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia_approach">Reggio Emilia-inspired preschool</a>.</li><li>Starred in a&nbsp;<em>Survivor-</em>style television&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousseau">Emile Rousseau</a>&nbsp;(we decided to boot&nbsp;<a href="https://danielbigler.squarespace.com/config#">Locke</a>&nbsp;off the island).</li><li>Attended graduate school. Twice. Not sure why. The first time was at <a href="https://danielbigler.squarespace.com/config#">King's College London</a>, where I earned&nbsp;an MA degree in Childhood Studies;&nbsp;the second was at a university in Switzerland&nbsp;<a href="https://danielbigler.squarespace.com/config#">whose name I still can't pronounce</a>, where I'll earn a Master of Advanced Studies degree in Children's Rights (currently working on my dissertation).</li><li>Lived on a&nbsp;<a href="https://danielbigler.squarespace.com/config#">house boat&nbsp;</a>in London, and survived dozens of pirate attacks while doing so.</li><li>Won a trophy in elementary school. I don't remember what it was for, but it's my proudest accomplishment.</li></ul><p>As for what's next? Well, I'm thinking about joining a barbershop quartet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Thinking deeply about children in society.</h1>&nbsp;<h2>Style Mode: Presets</h2><p>Native includes two preset styles, Light &amp; Dark. These are meant to be good starting points for you to begin customizing the colors and fonts the way you want.</p>

</div>&nbsp;<h2>Style Mode: Sizes &amp; Values</h2><p>Native lets you control the widths of major website sections like the Site, Blog Content and Page Content areas. You also get control over certain sections of padding.</p>

&nbsp;<h2>Blog Post With Promoted Block</h2><p>If the <strong>very first block</strong> in your post is not floated or added to a column &amp; contains <strong>one</strong> of the following: <strong>Image, Gallery, Video or Quote</strong>... it will 'promote' the element above the title and allow it to use the full site width.</p>

</div>&nbsp;<h2>Blog Post With Excerpts &amp; Thumbnail Image</h2><p>If you use an excerpt &amp; assign a thumbnail image to the post, Native will automatically put the thumbnail in a circle and center it above the title. It's a great feature that can dramatically change the look of your blog just by including a new behavior in your workflow.<br></p>

      <title>Manifesto</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 13:46:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="thekidsarealrightamanifesto">The Kids Are Alright: A Manifesto</h2>

<p>If there's an underlying motivation behind what I write here at Danielsaurus and why I write it, it's this simple idea: that <em>the kids are still alright these days</em>. </p>

<p>I see all children as capable, smart, caring, and curious, every one of them competent in their own ways – and each a valiant explorer of the world, if given the chance. Plenty of people have plenty of negative things to say about children and childhood today – and I've spent enough time with children themselves to know that most of it, simply, is just not true. So I want to put forth a different picture of things. I want to help children put their own voices out there, so that we can learn straight from them about their lives and cultures: about how they see the world, the trials and tribulations they may face, and what we, as adults, might be able to do to listen and understand them a bit better.</p>

<p>If there's a second idea behind Danielsaurus, it's this: at every point in their lives, <em>children are active and invested in approaching the world and interpreting it on their own terms</em>, within their own ways. They're anything but incomplete adults who must still learn the ways of the world – instead, they have worlds and cultures all of their own, that are separate, and frequently hidden, from us "grown-ups." They're creative in exploring their world, and they will actively resist any effort to diminish their world. And one of the most important things we can do to support them is recognize this – and offer a modicum of respect (and privacy) for their perspectives, places, and cultures.</p>

<p>And finally: <em>children are hardwired to explore and learn</em>. From the moment of their birth, children are truly voracious in their desire to engage in the world – exploring and engaging (if given the chance) in what interests them, actively constructing knowledge through their play and experiences, and diving in head first into challenges that they believe matter. Just like the rest of us, they experiment, make mistakes, and occasionally fail – eventually getting better through it all. And last, if given the chance – and the time, space, and freedom to do so – kids are capable of some truly incredible things. Why should we not try to see what they can do?</p>

<p>So that's my manifesto. I hope it seeps through everything you find here on Danielsaurus – and if any of all of that rings true for you personally, I truly hope that you will enjoy and read this blog regularly. (If that's something you already do, then from the bottom of my heart: thank you. It's nice to know you're reading.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On Failure, Torturing Children for No Apparent Reason, and "Better Get Used To It"</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/5/on-failure-torturing-children-and-better-get-used-to-it</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A great piece by Alfie Kohn: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It isn't usually spelled out quite so bluntly, but an awful lot of parenting practices are based on the belief that the best way to get kids ready for the painful things that may happen to them later is to make sure they experience plenty of pain while they're young. I call this BGUTI (rhymes with duty), which is the acronym of Better Get Used To It."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a kid, I distinctly remember really hating adults who told me that.</p>

<p><em>"Wash the dishes by hand? Really?" "Yep, that's just the way life is. Better Gets Used To It if you want clean plates."</em></p>

<p>Today = automatic dishwashers everywhere. (Granted, I still don't wash the dishes… it's on the schedule for next month, though, so don't worry about it.)</p>

<p><em>"Write in cursive? Learn trigonometry? How is this going to be useful for me again?" "It just is! Everyone uses cursive and performs complex trigonometry problems <strong>every day</strong> as an adult. You just Better Get Used To It..."</em></p>

<p>Today = haven't even thought about or seen cursive in ages, and type most everything on a mini-computer that fits in his pocket and has more computing power than the original space shuttle that went to the moon. Oh, and for the, oh, maybe one trigonometry problem I have a decade, Wolfram Alpha solves it for me in like two seconds.</p>

<p>What's so useful about Better Get Used to It again? </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Janosch commemorates the 20th anniversary of the show that legends are made of, <em>The Adventure of Pete &amp; Pete</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some time around 1993 at a Nickelodeon research center in New Jersey, Chris Viscardi and Will McRobb were forced to sit behind a sheet of mirrored glass and observe a dozen kids watch their new half-hour TV show <em>The Adventures Of Pete And Pete</em>. Eleven of those kids contorted their faces in such a way that the creators knew what they were thinking—"This is stupid." But one kid, with rumpled clothes and unkempt hair and food stains on his shirt, was smiling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So priceless. Here's to rumpled kids everywhere.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Waiter Refuses to Serve Customers Who Insulted a Down-Syndrome Child</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/1/waiter-refuses-to-serve-customers-who-insulted-a-down-syndrome-child</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your Sunday morning dose of awesome:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a group of regulars insulted a special needs customer at his restaurant, waiter Michael Garcia served them a dose of bravery. "My personal feelings just took over,” said Garcia, a waiter at Laurenzo’s Prime Rib in Houston, told KTRK. “And I told this man, 'I'm sorry, I can't serve you.'"</p>
  
  <p>Michael] Garcia, who has been working at Laurenzo’s for two years, was put in charge of two groups of regulars last Wednesday night. </p>
  
  <p>Kim Costillo was at one of Garcia’s tables. Costillo’s son Milo, a 5-year-old with Down syndrome, has been eating at Laurenzo’s for most of his short life. He’s quite popular with the waiters, so many were coming over to say hello, Costillo told local Houston blog 29-95.com. Milo hadn’t been at the restaurant for a few weeks, so he was chatting it up about his recent birthday. “We, adults, were encouraging Milo to say hi and show off some of his new vocabulary,” Costillo wrote to 29-95. “Was he loud? Maybe a little in the moment, but honestly, the adults at our table were [three times] louder than he was.”</p>
  
  <p>Some people at the restaurant didn’t share Milo’s excitement. </p>
  
  <p>Costillo and her family were sitting at their table for all of 10 minutes when a group across from them got up and moved to the back of the restaurant. Their waiter Michael Garcia didn’t think too much of the move until one bit of conversation caught his attention. He heard a man in the group say, “Special needs children need to be special somewhere else.”</p>

      <title>Senator Jay Rockefeller Calls for Video Games and Violence to be Studied</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/sen-jay-rockefeller-study-video-game-violence-brooks-boliek-politicocom</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senator Jay Rockefeller is also a nincompoop, and need only <a href="http://www.grandtheftchildhood.com">read this book</a> – based on a $1.5 million study done by researchers at the Harvard Medical School, and by far representing the most comprehensive and conclusive look at the research about video game violence – to know that for himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps more sadly, the good Senator is also demonstrating a none-too-subtle prejudice toward children and young people in the process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller introduced a bill Tuesday that would have the National Academy of Sciences examine any link between violent video games and media, and violent acts by children, industry sources say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Violence acts by children</em>... not violent acts by adults, or by people of all ages? As <a href="https://www.facebook.com/YouthRights/posts/490794614298475">the National Youth Rights Association points out</a>, "Does this sound like the first step a Senator would take to ban violent video games for adults? To ban violent entertainment for all ages? Or does it sound like once again a politician is preparing to punish youth for the crimes on an adult?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"Nation Impressed By Feats Of Very Strong Little Boy"</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/nation-impressed-by-feats-of-very-strong-little-boy</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Onion: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At approximately 3:45 p.m. Sunday, the pint-sized muscleman [7-year-old Michael Sartinsky] reportedly stunned the U.S. populace when he removed his T-shirt, walked confidently into his kitchen, located the 7-pound Perdue turkey his mother had just brought in from the family minivan and, without hesitating, deadlifted the frozen bird directly above his head.</p>
  
  <p>An informal poll found that 78 percent of U.S. citizens were most impressed when Sartinsky stripped down to his underwear and flexed in the bathroom mirror, 10 percent noted he was unbelievably fast—having handily bested his uncle Scott in a backyard footrace last spring—and 12 percent simply responded, "Oh, my, such a strong little man!"</p>

      <title>Mister Rogers to the Rescue</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/mister-rogers-to-the-rescue</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maura Judkis, The Washington Post: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As America reeled from the news of the shootings at Sandy Hook, parents looked for a way to explain the unexplainable to their children. But they also needed an explanation for themselves — someone to help process the magnitude of what it means to live in a world where 20 children can be gunned down amid storybooks and crayons.</p>
  
  <p>That person was — and will always be — Mister Rogers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judkis shares the touching story behind <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=447203981994488&amp;set=a.160250927356463.28026.150720154976207&amp;type=1">the reassuring quote and its accompanying photo</a> of Mister Rogers that gained in popularity over the weekend, urging us to "look for the helpers" following the devastation of the Sandy Hook shooting. He truly is one of my heroes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Guns or Children?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/guns-or-children</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The choice is a very real one, as David Murphey of the Child Trends Research Center demonstrates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much are our guns worth? 1,400 child deaths per year? 10,000 children wounded annually?</p>
  
  <p>It’s time we addressed the public health problem of guns.  Homicide is the second-leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year-olds, and the fourth-leading cause among 5- to 14-year-olds.  Overwhelmingly, guns are the weapons used in these killings. [...]</p>
  
  <p>How many guns do we have in the U.S.? One estimate puts it at 270 million, or nearly four guns for every American child. [...] [T]here is little evidence that owning guns makes anyone more safe. In fact, where there are more gun-owning households, after controlling for a number of demographic factors, local homicide rates are greater.</p>
  
  <p>So what will it take to loosen our grip on guns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Child Trends – one of the most data-driven, nonpartisan centers for research about children and families – calls out guns as an issue of public health, you know the case for it to do so is a clear one.</p>

<p>Guns or children; we can't protect both.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Adults Can Best Help Kids Respond to Mass Killings and Violence</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/how-adults-can-best-help-kids-respond-to-mass-killings-and-violence</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LeVar Burton:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our children rely on us to help them define the world they live in, and at the same time they have razor sharp radar for when the truth is being hidden from them.  Being honest with them, respecting when they want to talk and when they don’t, accepting their reactions as “appropriate” no matter what they are, and then returning to your family’s routine is the best we can do during these media fueled, tragedies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keeping in line with that last sentence, Roger Ebert similarly offered his opinion on how to minimize the emotional toll of these mass killings: <a href="http://kottke.org/12/12/roger-ebert-on-the-medias-coverage-of-school-shootings">just stop focusing on them</a>, and don't reward media or news outlets who do. The fear they spread helps no one   — especially not children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Strong Towns and Playborhoods</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/strong-towns-and-playborhoods</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mike Lanza, in a conversation about new urbanism, building communities, and children's neighborhood play:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And just to say another word about empathy for kids, if you really take off your “Hey, I’m bigger than you” hat and look at the world from the view of a kid you realize, hey, they can’t drive, they’re not allowed. They have no way to get around other than to walk or bike, unless you put them in that damn car seat and they’re sitting there strapped in looking at the back of your head. So if you want them to have any semblance of a life outside of you, you have to look at the world from the point of view of, if the only option is to walk or bike, how can we make this work?</p>
  
  <p>And from the perspective of a kid, if you want to convince me to go outside, it better be interesting out there. It’s really boring in most neighborhoods. We’ve got these great videogames and TV and Internet inside the house. You walk outside there’s nothing going on. Just to look at the world from a kid’s point of view is a big shift.</p>

      <title>Let Them Eat Homework!</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/three-cheers-for-no-homework</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NPR digs into the French government's plan to <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/2012/10/the-president-completely-bans-homework">ban homework</a> across their nation – and the opposition to it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Poor people want homework because they know that school is very important, and the only chance — the only possibility — they have to give their children a better life is if their children succeed at school," says Emmanuel Davidenkoff, editor-in-chief of L'Etudiant, a magazine and website devoted to French school and education.</p>
  
  <p>Davidenkoff says the Socialist government doesn't seem to understand the concerns of the working and middle class and in the name of equality, got it all wrong.</p>
  
  <p>"Mostly, wealthy people don't want homework because when the kids are at home, they make sports or dance or music. They go to the museums, to the theater. So they have this access to culture, which is very important," he says. "In poor families, they don't have that, so the only link they have with culture and school is homework."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really does appear that the majority of this debate – at least politically – is taking place within the framework of class equality. It's's none too disheartening to watch education get boiled down to a simple matter of economics like this, but hey, I can take solace in the fact that at least some people get it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, French school is a grind, says Peter Gumbel, author of a scathing book on the education system in France.</p>
  
  <p>"There's an enormous amount of pressure, and it's no fun whatsoever. There's no sport or very little sport, very little art, very little music. Kids don't have a good time at all."</p>

      <title>Maily: An Email App for Kids "That Isn't Dumbed Down"</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/maily-an-email-app-for-kids-that-isnt-dumbed-down</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/40147990?wmode=opaque&amp;api=1" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
 
<p>Gotta credit Boing Boing with this great find:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maily is a fun way for kids of 4 and up to stay in touch with their relatives by email. It's a free iPad app that allows parents to set up a list of email recipients, in the form of headshots. Your kid can create images by mixing photos, freehand drawing, and drag-and-drop skip art onto the screen, then send it to a recipient by tapping their headshot.</p>
  
  <p>Paranoid parents can use a setting that shunts their kid's incoming email into their own inbox, so they can make sure grandma didn't send an off-color joke before forwarding it to junior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually kinda wish all my email were like this. Especially with being able to filter out grandma's dirty jokes; no one should have to see those, grandma!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Hair Isn't Everything</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/hair-isnt-everything</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I admit it: Jada Pinkett-Smith impressed the hell out of me earlier today. Facing questions and media criticism about why she had let her daughter Willow shave her head, the actress decided to write the following response on her Facebook page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question why I would LET Willow cut her hair. First the LET must be challenged. This is a world where women, girls are constantly reminded that they don't belong to themselves; that their bodies are not their own, nor their power or self determination. I made a promise to endow my little girl with the power to always know that her body, spirit and her mind are HER domain. Willow cut her hair because her beauty, her value, her worth is not measured by the length of her hair. It's also a statement that claims that even little girls have the RIGHT to own themselves and should not be a slave to even their mother's deepest insecurities, hopes and desires. Even little girls should not be a slave to the preconceived ideas of what a culture believes a little girl should be. More to come. Another day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(She also wrote that <em>on her phone</em>. Even more impressed.)</p>

<p>It's a wonderful example of just how much it isn't about the shaved head, or the boy wearing a skirt, or whether kids act "well-behaved" out in public. When you think about the bigger picture – about who children really are as individuals, and the values you wish for them to grow up owning as their own – it all becomes clear: the hair is really the last thing that matters.</p>

      <title>How Eastern And Western Cultures Tackle Learning</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/how-eastern-and-western-cultures-tackle-learning</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alix Spiegel for NPR, writing about the differences researchers have found between how Eastern and Western cultures approach education and learning: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I think that from very early ages we [in America] see struggle as an indicator that you're just not very smart," Stigler says. "It's a sign of low ability — people who are smart don't struggle, they just naturally get it, that's our folk theory. Whereas in Asian cultures they tend to see struggle more as an opportunity."</p>
  
  <p>In Eastern cultures, Stigler says, it's just assumed that struggle is a predictable part of the learning process. Everyone is expected to struggle in the process of learning, and so struggling becomes a chance to show that you, the student, have what it takes emotionally to resolve the problem by persisting through that struggle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lori Pickert, author of the blog <a href="http://project-based-homeschooling.com/camp-creek-blog/helpless-vs-mastery-oriented">Project Based Homeschooling</a>, frames this helpfully within the contexts of <a href="http://project-based-homeschooling.com/camp-creek-blog/helpless-vs-mastery-oriented">learning helplessness vs. mastery-oriented education</a> and <a href="http://project-based-homeschooling.com/camp-creek-blog/perfectionism-and-praise">perfectionism and praise</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>If the day ever came when we were able to accept ourselves and our children exactly as we and they are, then, I believe, we would have come very close to an ultimate understanding of what “good” parenting means. It’s part of being human to fall short of that total acceptance – and often far short. But one of the most important gifts a parent can give a child is the gift of accepting that child’s uniqueness.<span>&#148;</span>

      <title>'The Pedophile Smear'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/the-pedophile-smear</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only a day after <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/blog/2012/11/kevin-clash-takes-leave-from-sesame-street-denying-accusations-of-an-underage-relationship">the accusation surfaced</a> that Kevin Clash had engaged in an inappropriate underage relationship, the Sesame Street puppeteer's accuser recanted the claim, admitting that the relationship was an adult consensual one.</p>

<p>Truly everything about this story is unfortunate, since Clash really is an endearing, remarkable man who has dedicated his life to children – and whose <a href="http://beingelmo.com">passion and care for them is widely evident</a>. I'm hardpressed not to agree with Andrew Sullivan when he highlights the true damage of such false claims and our public reaction to them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twice recently, two individuals have been falsely accused of one of the most vile crimes imaginable - the sexual abuse of children. [...] Even now, the false accuser in the Elmo case, 23 years old, remains anonymous, while his target has to endure this media hazing. This story is not about the voice of Elmo being a pedophile; it's about a person anonymously smearing someone else's reputation.</p>

      <title>Fathers Are the New Videogame Superhero</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/fathers-are-the-new-videogame-superhero</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Groen, for Wired:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The faceless, furious badass main character that has become so cliche in today’s games is dying out, and he’s about to be replaced by a new kind of hero. Dad.</p>
  
  <p>Recently, we’ve seen major games starring characters like a workaday father on a mining operation saving up money for his family (<em>Lost Planet 3</em>), soldiers driven by love of family (<em>Medal of Honor, Dead Space 3</em>) or men acting as surrogate fathers for lost little girls (<em>The Walking Dead, I Am Alive, The Last of Us</em>). In each of these games, the goal seems to be to take videogame storytelling beyond the average cookie-cutter action heroes in order to dig at deeper emotions and motivations.</p>
  
  <p>“People will do absolutely anything for their families,” said Sean Vanaman, lead writer on the Walking Dead videogame.</p>

      <title>Super Nanny, in Perspective</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/super-nanny-in-perspective</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A letter from Honest Toddler to Super Nanny:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Super? So you think you’re an action hero. And what is your power exactly? Tearing families apart?</p>
  
  <p>Since your show started and like a pregnant spider exploded into countless demonic spin-offs, children around the world have been suffering from your ridiculous and terrible ideas. The fact that parents are starting sentences off with “Well, on Super Nanny…” to excuse the creation of time out spots and restrictions on big bed time only adds evidence to my claim. [...]</p>
  
  <p>The day you come into my home expect Armageddon because I’m going to bring it. Nanny, you don’t know my life. You don’t know my situation. Were you at my birth? Are you my midwife? No. So you don’t know what I need. [...] You can’t just think you can create chore charts for people too young to even read and think you’re going to get away with it. Lots of us have systems in our homes that are working just fine. This is America, not boarding school. I don’t know how things in work in England but here across the pond we wear Crocs -plastic shoes- in broad daylight. We don’t eat crumpets; it’s cereal in dollar store tupperware all day long. And juice. Our juice is red and cold like the vengeance I’m about to unleash on you shortly after nap time today depending on how I feel.</p>
  
  <p>not love,</p>
  
  <p>HT</p>

      <title>Kevin Clash Takes Leave from Sesame Street, Denying Accusations of an Underage Relationship</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/kevin-clash-takes-leave-from-sesame-street-denying-accusations-of-an-underage-relationship</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kevin Clash, the Muppeteer behind Sesame Street's Elmo, has taken a leave of absence from the children's show amidst allegations that he had an underage relationship. For its part, the Sesame Workshop found no evidence to substantiate the allegations after an investigation and <a href="http://www.muppetcentral.com/news/2012/111212.shtml">issued the following statement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In June of this year, Sesame Workshop received a communication from a then 23 year old man who alleged that he had a relationship beginning when he was 16 years old with Kevin Clash, a Sesame Workshop puppeteer who performs as Elmo.</p>
  
  <p>We took the allegation very seriously and took immediate action. We met with the accuser twice and had repeated communications with him. We met with Kevin, who denied the accusation. We also conducted a thorough investigation and found the allegation of underage conduct to be unsubstantiated. Although this was a personal relationship unrelated to the workplace, our investigation did reveal that Kevin exercised poor judgment and violated company policy regarding internet usage and he was disciplined.</p>
  
  <p>Kevin insists that the allegation of underage conduct is false and defamatory and he is taking actions to protect his reputation. We have granted him a leave of absence to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/11/12/elmo-puppeteer-kevin-clash-accused-of-affair-with-minor/">In a statement provided by his publicist</a>, Clash admitted to the relationship, but said it began when the accuser was an adult:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I am a gay man. I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter. I had a relationship with the accuser,” Clash said. “It was between two consenting adults and I am deeply saddened that he is trying to characterize it as something other than what it was. I am taking a break from Sesame Workshop to deal with this false and defamatory allegation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UPDATE: Only one day after the accusation, Clash's accuser <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/blog/2012/11/the-pedophile-smear">withdrew the claim</a> – proving how damaging and unfortunate such false claims can be, especially for those who have dedicated their lives to children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Installment #24 of Kids Doing Awesome Things: Four African Teenagers Create a Pee-Powered Generator</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/the-latest-installment-of-kids-doing-awesome-things-four-african-teenagers-create-a-pee-powered-generator</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/501c8d6b24ac0a1285ed8244/501c8d6b24ac0a1285ed8259/509f3e6be4b039333cb51b47/1352613498395/8161674482_b25d1014c6_h.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>Wow. Well, that certainly wasn't a headline I was expecting to write today. As <a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2012/11/07/forget-apps-and-other-useless-startups-these-four-african-girls-have-created-a-pee-powered-generator/">The Next Web</a> reports, though, 14-year-olds Duro-Aina Adebola, Akindele Abiola, Faleke Oluwatoyin, and 15-year-old Bello Eniola  from Nigeria have managed to invent... a urine-powered generator.</p><p>They're currently showcasing it at Maker Faire Africa, and one liter of pee is purported to provide six hours' worth of electricity. (The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20167122">BBC is currently showing off</a> a few other innovations from the Maker Faire, too.)</p>

<p>Here's how the pee-generator works:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Urine is put into an electrolytic cell, which separates out the hydrogen.</li>
  <li>The hydrogen goes into a water filter for purification, which then gets pushed into the gas cylinder.</li>
  <li>The gas cylinder pushes hydrogen into a cylinder of liquid borax, which is used to remove the moisture from the hydrogen gas.</li>
  <li>This purified hydrogen gas is pushed into the generator.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to say, those are some real <em>whiz</em> kids. (I'M SORRY! I'm sorry, okay? But that joke was inevitable.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"I refuse to lie to children. I refuse to cater to the bullshit of innocence."</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/i-refuse-to-cater-to-the-bullshit-of-innocence</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's just too much to cherish in this <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/201211/?read=interview_sendak">late, wonderful, sprawling and idiosyncratic interview</a> with author and illustrator <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/blog?tag=Maurice+Sendak">Maurice Sendak</a>, who passed away this past year at age 83 – leaving the world one short a delightfully grumpy, Jewish, spiritual grandfather to us all.</p>

<p>If I had to pick a favorite passage from it, however, it'd be this one – a story Sendak shares in response to a question about the kinds of letters he likes to receive from children:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When [children] write on their own, they’re ferocious. After <strong>Outside Over There</strong>, which is my favorite book of mine, a little girl wrote to me from Canada: "I like all of your books, why did you write this book, this is the first book I hate. I hate the babies in this book, why are they naked, I hope you die soon. Cordially…" Her mother added a note: "I wondered if I should even mail this to you—I didn’t want to hurt your feelings." I was so elated. It was so natural and spontaneous. The mother said, "You should know I am pregnant and she has been fiercely opposed to it." Well, she didn’t want competition, and the whole book was about a girl who’s fighting against having to look after her baby sister.</p>
  
  <p>BLVR: You find the unvarnished truth consoling, even if it’s vicious and painful.</p>
  
  <p>MS: If it’s true, then you can’t care about the vicious and the painful. You can only be astonished. Most kids don’t dare tell the truth. Kids are the politest people in the world. A letter like that is wonderful. "I wish you would die." I should have written back, "Honey, I will; just hold your horses."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a fine example of the kind of honesty that Sendak cherished so much in life, and practiced so well himself. Though it led many to write about his "legendary crossness," Sendak in fact simply had an "impatience with artifice" – as his interviewer Emma Brockes notes. It was an impatience that he extended especially to matters of "Childhood." Sendak detested how adults would often treat children differently, and he believed the "bullshit of innocence" that was so firmly held to by many adults about children would often blind them from seeing the real emotions and intentions of children. Even more, Sendak recognized how children themselves often understood this, and eventually learned to take part in the complicated game of charades surrounding it. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/maurice-sendak-on-the-first-book-hes-written-and-illustrated-in-30-years/245342/">In a 2011 interview in The Atlantic</a>, he shared this story to illustrate the lengths children will go to avoid disturbing their parents:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I knew a little girl who told her parents – because her school was close by the twin towers when it happened – and she told her father that she saw the butterflies coming out of the windows. And only later said: "They weren't butterflies. They were people." But she lied, at first, to make him more comfortable. And that's what kids do – they are immensely courageous. And they sacrifice a lot. And they try to play mute and dumb because – well, it's kind of the expectation of their parents.</p>
  
  <p>That's what all the fairy tales are all mostly about – about the vulnerability of children and how they figure out tricks and ways of living in the world and making up parents. Make-believe parents. And I think that's probably one of the hardest jobs in the world. Being a parent, and not succumbing to failure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, sometimes parents do get it right – as it is <a href="https://twitter.com/lettersofnote/status/199839306616020992">in this story</a>. Sendak had received a rather charming letter from a young boy, so he sent him back a postcard with a drawing of a wild thing. The boy's mother later wrote back to Sendak: "Jim loved your card so much he ate it." </p>

<p>He saw it, he loved it, he ate it.</p>

<p>That's the way it should be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"Our Hearts Grow Smarter"</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/our-hearts-grow-smarter</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have found that people – men especially – have actually become more emotionally intelligent and aware over time. David Brooks argues that this shift is an important part of our cultural progress:</p>

  <p>In the 1930s and 1940s, the researchers didn't pay much attention to the men's relationships. Instead, following the intellectual fashions of the day, they paid a lot of attention to the men's physiognomy. Did they have a "masculine" body type? Did they show signs of vigorous genetic endowments?</p>
  
  <p>But as this study -- the Grant Study -- progressed, the power of relationships became clear. The men who grew up in homes with warm parents were much more likely to become first lieutenants and majors in World War II. The men who grew up in cold, barren homes were much more likely to finish the war as privates.</p>
  
  <p>Body type was useless as a predictor of how the men would fare in life. So was birth order or political affiliation. Even social class had a limited effect. <em>But having a warm childhood was powerful. As George Vaillant, the study director, sums it up in "Triumphs of Experience," his most recent summary of the research, "It was the capacity for intimate relationships that predicted flourishing in all aspects of these men's lives."</em></p>

      <title>How Kids Are Plotting to Take Over the World</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/another-fine-example-of-why-kids-rock</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The headline for this one about says it all: "Ethiopian Kids Hack OLPC Tablets in 5 Months with Zero Instruction."</p>

<p>There's quite a fascinating history behind the One Laptop Per Child (or OLPC) movement. As an organization, they've come a long way since its bold, yet controversial beginnings – its early years were mired in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">geopolitical and international development debates</a>, and even arguments about what kind of software the laptops should run. OLPC's founder Nicholas Negroponte, though, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/429206/emtech-preview-another-way-to-think-about-learning/">clearly now has it nailed</a>. Self-organized learning is where it's at – and, through OLPC, we're now getting to see what a difference it makes when we simply trust children. Another great example of this can be found in Sugata Mitra's <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2012/01/24/new-ted-book-asks-can-changing-how-we-teach-make-our-kids-smarter-more-creative/">'Hole in the Wall' experiment</a>: where Mitra introduced, with no instruction, a networked PC within a (literal) hole in the wall, in an urban slum in New Dehli. Here's what he discovered afterward:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Experiments show that children in unsupervised groups are capable of answering questions many years ahead of the material they’re learning in school. In fact, they seem to enjoy the absence of adult supervision, and they are very confident of finding the right answer. Ultimately, they retain the learning effortlessly and for years, much longer than what we see with rote memorization of facts and figures. [...] Right now, we have a generation of children 16 years old or younger who have never known a world without many of the connecting technologies that we take for granted and rely on heavily. How do these devices affect, and even improve, how we absorb information? Self-organized learning would not work at all without the Internet. Educationists have suggested this type of instruction as a method for years, but the resources were not there until recently. Now, with the Internet, we have the means and the capabilities to watch self-organized learning flourish. It’s a very exciting time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An exciting time, indeed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2012/10/fred-rogers-fearless-authenticity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Preserved by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FredRogersCenter/posts/368409186581259">Fred Rogers Center</a>, here's a poignant story about the children's television show host's approach to education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a reporter once asked Fred why his program did not spend more time teaching “numbers and letters,” Fred replied, “I would rather give them the tools for learning. If we give them the tools, they’ll want to learn the facts. More importantly, they’ll use the facts to build and not to destroy.”</p>

      <title>Why Do Children Cover Their Eyes When They Hide?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/why-do-young-children-cover-their-eyes-when-they-hide</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge get to the bottom of this important question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now things get a little complicated. In both studies so far, when the children thought they were invisible by virtue of their eyes being covered, they nonetheless agreed that their head and their body were visible. They seemed to be making a distinction between their "self" that was hidden, and their body, which was still visible. Taken together with the fact that it was the concealment of the eyes that seemed to be the crucial factor for feeling hidden, the researchers wondered if their invisibility beliefs were based around the idea that there must be eye contact between two people -- a meeting of gazes -- for them to see each other (or at least, to see their "selves").</p>

      <title>The UK Boy Scouts Clamp Down on Nicknames</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/the-uk-boy-scouts-clamp-down-on-nicknames</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of an effort to prevent bullying, the UK Scout Association is issuing new guidelines to scoutleaders about the use of nicknames for children.</p>

<p>Their chief safeguarding officer Sam Marks explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Research and experience all highlight that name calling – whether it be nicknames or harmless taunting – is often the largest form of bullying. [...] If someone is called Frederick and you call them Freddie then there is no problem with that.</p>
  
  <p>"But you need to ask why that person has a nickname – if it is because they have red hair or are fat or they have a funny face, or because they did something funny and it stuck with them? They might be quite embarrassed by that."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting move on the Scout Association's part, to be sure – <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marc.armitage.play/posts/426233200772063">though as Marc Armitage asks</a>, "Are nicknames the same as hate-names?" I'm glad to see that many within the organization are thinking about what makes a nickname "good or bad", rather than simply issuing a blanket ban of using nicknames in general. And it's understandable that we adults would want to protect children from societal prejudice and hate; I personally wouldn't want to see adults introducing nicknames for children that are based on immutable personal characteristics or have negative connotations associated with them. In general, actually, I prefer adults follow children's lead about what they want to be called. That said, this whole nicknaming dilemma becomes a challenge when it is part of a broader effort on the part of adults (intentionally or not) to govern children's language and cultures.</p>

<p>One side to discussions like this one that is often left out or forgotten is the conceptual autonomy of children's cultures. We sometimes don't realize it, or think about it often, but children do have their own self-created, peer-based cultures that are separate from our adult culture – and the use of nicknames, shared lore and language, and other verbal play between children <a href="http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Me-Pa/Opie-Iona-and-Peter.html">typically assume a foundation role in these cultures</a>. They're all a sign of ownership and investment on the part of children, and they go alongside peer leadership, and secrecy, and child-controlled places as key elements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_secret_club#Key_elements">children's secret clubs and special friendship groups</a>. And for us adults, it's often best we <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=D3x1FHpwrlsC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=making+a+place+in+the+curriculum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S8oh9YMNBx&amp;sig=9K6E2AOC5jm88vgvWacGjcMZqyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MCyIUJO9BOjKiwKfsoH4Cg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=making%20a%20place%20in%20the%20curriculum&amp;f=false">tread lightly</a> whenever we become involved in this aspect of children's lives and experiences. As David Sobel, a renowned educator and researcher of children's geographies, noted: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Some aspects of children's lives are better left alone. Although it is a completely valid objective of progressive educators to relate the curriculum to the child's life, I have a sense that there are realms in which the adult should not trespass." </p>

      <title>From STEM to STEAM: 'Art in K-12 is Key to Building a Strong Economy'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/stem-to-steam-art-in-k-12-is-key-to-building-a-strong-economy</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building on the widely popular, politically lauded concept of STEM education – education that places science, technology, engineering and mathematics at its core – John Maeda, the President of the Rhode Island School of Design, offers his thoughts on the future direction K-12 education in America:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I applaud the growing and necessary focus on spurring innovation worldwide, and as a lifelong STEM student myself, I've seen firsthand the innovation that STEM education can produce. But I've also witnessed STEM's limits, and there is a rising new voice out there that has an additional viewpoint on how to keep America competitive -- at an even higher level. For the past several years, I have been arguing that we need to add the "A" for Art to turn STEM to STEAM. [...] </p>
  
  <p>What does it mean to turn STEM to STEAM? The problem-solving, the fearlessness, and the critical thinking and making skills that I see every day in the RISD studios are the same skills that will keep our country innovating, and their development needs to start in the K-12 schools. Design creates the innovative products and solutions that will propel our economy forward, and artists ask the deep questions about humanity that reveal which way forward actually is. Sustaining arts education in its own right remains critically important. But equally important is taking a page from schools that have been successful at integrating the arts into STEM curriculum.</p>

      <title>A Brooklyn High School Embraces Tech-Based Vocational Education</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/a-brooklyn-high-school-embraces-tech-based-vocational-education</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An inspiring example of what might hopefully lie ahead for secondary education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By 2017, the first wave of students of P-Tech — Pathways in Technology Early College High School — is expected to emerge with associate’s degrees in applied science in computer information systems or electromechanical engineering technology, following a course of studies developed in consultation with I.B.M.</p>
  
  <p>“I mean, in 10th grade, doing college work?” said Monesia McKnight, 15, as she sat in an introduction to computer systems course taught by a college professor. “How great is that?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, P-Tech isn't without precedence: you need only look to <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/vocational-education-benefits-mark-phillips">Finland and Norway's systems of public education</a> to see how well forward-thinking technical education like this has served their countries' young people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Clearly, the good editorial staff at <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/235175/the-puzzling-case-of-boys-who-are-hitting-puberty-earlier">The Week</a> weren't listening to them when they said it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Inside The Boy Scouts’ ‘Perversion’ Files</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/inside-the-boy-scouts-perversion-files</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winston Ross examines the so-called 'Perversion Files' – some 14,500 pages of records released last Thursday – that the Boy Scouts of America used to keep record of former Scout leaders or volunteers who were banned from the organization for alleged sexual misconduct or prior convictions.</p>

<p>Just despicable. I've been too angry at the Boy Scouts this past week/three months/five years to say anything more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>'The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of Mathematics Education'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/the-unreasonable-ineffectiveness-of-mathematics-education</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alex Reinhart offers an interesting take on how we get math education so wrong – and why it's important to make it right: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why? Why do math? Because you’ll need it, that’s why. You’ll use it in your physics classes. And I’m sure I can think of examples of how you’ll use math in real life, whatever your chosen career may be. Right? Right. I hear engineers have to know how to solve differential equations, for example, and before you can do differential equations you need to learn logarithms. So get back to chapter 14 and get working.</p>
  
  <p>This is the message we’re giving our children, and it’s no wonder so few students develop an interest in mathematics.</p>

      <title>Nick Kristof Cuddles with Paul Tough (Wait, What?)</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/nick-kristof-cuddles-with-paul-tough-wait-what</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though there's not much new to report here if you've been <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/blog?tag=Paul+Tough">following along</a> with Paul Tough's book – <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547564651/?tag=danielsaurusrex-20">How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character</a></em> – it's also not a big secret that I absolutely love everything Nick Kristof writes, and so it's nice to see him devote his latest column to the research and ideas that Tough has brought to the table: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The evidence is mounting that conservatives are right about some fundamental issues relating to poverty. For starters, we can’t talk just about welfare or tax policy but must also consider culture and character.</p>
  
  <p>“There is no antipoverty tool we can provide for disadvantaged young people that will be more valuable,” Tough writes, than grit, resilience, perseverance and optimism.</p>
  
  <p>Yet conservatives sometimes mistakenly see that as the end of the conversation.</p>
  
  <p>“This science suggests a very different reality,” Tough writes. “It says that the character strengths that matter so much to young people’s success are not innate; they don’t appear in us magically, as a result of good luck or good genes. And they are not simply a choice. They are rooted in brain chemistry, and they are molded, in measurable and predictable ways, by the environment in which kids grow up. That means the rest of us — society as a whole — can do an enormous amount to influence their development.”</p>

      <title>Unsolicited Evaluation Is the Enemy of Creativity</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/unsolicited-evaluation-is-the-enemy-of-creativity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Psychologist Peter Gray follows <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/2012/9/as-childrens-freedom-has-declined-so-has-their-creativity">his previous column</a> about the inherent correlation between children's freedom and their creativity with a new, and truly superb summary of why unsolicited advice is a real creativity killer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In physically demanding tasks, like lifting heavy weights, and in tedious tasks, like counting beans, we do better when we are being evaluated than when we are not. But in tasks that require creativity, or new insights, or new learning, we do better when we are not being evaluated—when we are just playing, not stressed, not afraid of failure.  Evaluation generally promotes effort — because we want to impress the evaluator – but effort is insufficient for creativity. You can’t be more creative just by trying harder. To be creative, you have to back off of yourself in a way that permits the full engagement of certain unconscious mental processes—processes that generate unusual associations and new ideas. Those unconscious processes work best when you are playing, not when you are striving for praise or some other reward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Dr. Gray concludes, is it any wonder that children have become less and less creative as parents and educators focus more and more attention on their "success"?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>The Dundee Elementary School third-grader comes to school dressed as a different historical figure or character — Every. Single. Day. And she's done that since the second day of second grade, when this all started.</p>
  
  <p>The budding actress with a social conscience came to school on the first day last year dressed like any other 7-year-old girl, in the outfit her grandpa had bought her: a Love T-shirt and leggings. The following day she was dressed as author Laura Ingalls Wilder.</p>
  
  <p>From that point on, Stella decided that what she would wear to school would represent who she was trying to be. With no repeats, at least through second grade.</p>

      <title>Boys Might Be Starting Puberty Earlier, Too</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/boys-might-be-starting-puberty-earlier-too</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While a scientific consensus has developed in recent years that American girls are now hitting puberty earlier, on average, than the historic norm, a large study just released by the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests the same may be true for boys as well. Pam Belluck, reporting for the New York Times, offers a more nuanced look:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The study, widely considered the most reliable attempt to measure puberty in American boys, estimates that boys are showing signs of puberty six months to two years earlier than was reported in previous research, which historically taught that 11 ½ was the general age puberty began in boys. [...] </p>
  
  <p>The study, which was to be announced at the Academy of Pediatrics national conference on Saturday and published online in the journal Pediatrics, did not try to determine what might be causing earlier puberty, although it mentioned changes in diet, less physical activity and other environmental factors as possibilities. Experts said that without further research, implications for boys are unclear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The primary message first and foremost, according to the study's authors and other experts, should be one of cautious curiosity: while the study provides usful new data for those in the pediatric and urology fields, "the study should not prompt a magazine 'cover article that shows a 9-year-old boy shaving,'" Ms. Belluck cites one expert as saying.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting issues associated with earlier puberty onset for both boys and girls, however, are the social ramifications. Whatever our views on the subject are, I believe most Americans (and American culture by and large) do not deal well with perceived disparities between children's biological development and our own social constructions of childhood. Maggie Koerth-Baker addresses the difficulties that can accompany this especially well, I think, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/10/20/boys-might-be-hitting-puberty.html">over at Boing Boing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if both boys and girls are hitting puberty earlier, scientists acknowledge that the social results are very, very different. Parents don't particularly care when their 9-year-old son's testicles get bigger. Parents are deeply concerned when their 9-year-old daughter grows breasts. And with good reason. Even if a woman otherwise looks very young, people start treating her differently once the boobs kick in — "differently" in ways that can be really problematic for a 9-year-old. I had a friend in grade school who had breasts by 4th or 5th grade. She'd get cat-called on the street by grown men. </p>

      <title>Anti-Testing Movement Continues to Gain Traction in NYC</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/an-anti-testing-movement-continues-to-gain-traction-in-nyc</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Times reports on the continued effort of a growing group of parents who are boycotting the recently introduced standardized field testing in New York City:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I want my school to use tests to help instruction, to help find out if kids don’t know fractions,” [one parent activist] said. “I don’t want my child to feel like her score will decide if her teacher has a job or not.”</p>

<p>Obviously there's plenty of varying motivations all around driving the boycott – but hey, at least it's a start.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>... at least in France. Which is not the USA. Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>Carmen Chai, for Global News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Banning homework for students may sound like the plans of a high school class president, but in France, it’s Francois Hollande’s latest policy.</p>
  
  <p>The newly-elected French president may be trying to foster his popularity among the next generation of voters after he made a series of wide-ranging education reforms – with a nationwide ban on homework as the most controversial of the list.</p>
  
  <p>“Education is priority. An education program is, by definition, a societal program. Work should be done at school rather than at home,” he said, according to French media reports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, it will remain a core educational policy that children should be provided cigarettes during their recess breaks and served red wine at lunch.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Buzz Lightyear and a Swedish Pop Star</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/buzz-lightyear-and-a-swedish-pop-star</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Play scholar Marc Armitage shares about a revelation his friend's young son had one day when he uncovered new information about his childhood infatuation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Viktor’s passion for Per Gessle become as significant as it had earlier for Buzz Lightyear until one day he took out the little booklet from inside one of his CDs. Inside the booklet were photographs of buildings that he recognised which made him curious so he asked his father, ‘Why are these photographs here in this little book?’ Anders explained to him that these were photographs of buildings in Halmstad because Gessle lives here in Halmstad.</p>
  
  <p>Viktor was suddenly wide eyed and shocked. Eventually he stammered, “You mean, Per Gessle is a REAL person?”</p>
  
  <p>He genuinely hadn’t realised. His hero Buzz Lightyear was larger than life … but he wasn’t real and he knew that. To now discover that the equally bigger than life Per Gessle however WAS real … can you imagine the shock?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a similar revelation about Star Wars when I was growing up. But I digress:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When, I wonder, was the last time we experienced a similar shock of discovering that something we were absolutely convinced about actually turned out to completely wrong? [...]  As we become older and wiser and more knowledgeable, the possibility of those moments seems to grow less likely and our ability to be profoundly taken aback rarer.</p>
  
  <p>Personally I’m not sure that’s such a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't say I'm so sure, either... although it is kinda nice knowing now that Yoda is for real.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Force is Still with 'Star Wars'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/the-evergreen-appeal-of-star-wars-for-a-new-generation</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alan Greenblatt shares about the everlasting appeal of Star Wars – now being enjoyed by a young generation of kids, many of whom have never even seen the original films:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's no mystery to why Star Wars remains popular with young boys, says Robert Thompson, a pop culture professor at Syracuse University. It's got just about everything they like — spaceships, creatures that look like dinosaurs, creatures that look like teddy bears.</p>
  
  <p>"The films are exquisitely simple and executed in a way so that they're user-friendly to a kid," he says. [...]</p>
  
  <p>The depth of Star Wars' imaginative world is a major part of the attraction. Lots of young boys can rattle off information about the differences between spaceships or entire galaxies without having seen any of the movies.</p>
  
  <p>"Boys versed in Star Wars share a private language about a vast technical universe that is simultaneously imaginary and concrete, re-created in Lego plastic blocks," Paglia says in an email interview.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait, he's talking about kids – not grown adults? Oh. Um... Yeahhhhh, maybe I like Star Wars too much.</p>

<p>(Oh, and don't miss <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/thebigevent/2012/10/04/star-wars-opens-at-the-coronet-are-you-in-these-1977-photos/">this great photo recollection</a> of the  1977 opening of of the original <em>Star Wars</em> film. I wish I were old enough to be in those photographs!)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Chasing the Clouds Away</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/chasing-the-clouds-away</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Przeworski, a psychologist who specialized in anxiety disorders in children, adolescents, and adults, reflects on living life "the Sesame Street way":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t help but think that that there is wisdom in the way life is lived on Sesame Street and that perhaps we would all be happier and less stressed if we tried just a little harder to live our lives that way.  I am not advocating that we all live a fantasy life where there is no crime, no financial woes, we hang out with Muppets, and our biggest life questions are about what type of animal a Snuffleupagus is.  Instead, I am suggesting that perhaps we need to live our very real and stressful lives based on the tenets that we instill in our children—be kind and friendly to others and help others out when you can. We all need reminders to live our lives that way and of how good it feels to live your life based on these tenets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm an old school fan, and will probably always regard Elmo with an air of suspicion for overtaking Grover's popularity and ushering in a different era of Sesame Street, but I just don't know how you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlz5JmZ0POE">examples</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG4zoI0DsTQ">like</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdos4P-O8jY">this</a> and not think that's worth our support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the astrophysicist's words: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Cutting PBS support (0.012% of budget) to help balance the Federal budget is like deleting text files to make room on your 500Gig hard drive."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forbes puts that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2012/10/04/romney-promises-to-cut-taxpayer-funding-for-pbs-but-says-he-still-loves-big-bird/">into further context</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The federal funding that Romney was referencing isn’t a direct subsidy to PBS. The funding actually flows to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). CPB was created by Congress before PBS existed, in 1968 after the promotion of public media was noted “of appropriate and important concern” to the federal government. By statute, the board of CPB is to be bipartisan: three Democrats and three Republicans. As part of its mission, it supports not only PBS but also National Public Radio (NPR).</p>
  
  <p>For fiscal year 2010, federal funding for PBS through CPB accounted for about 12% of PBS’ revenue. In terms of dollars, that works out to about $300 million. There’s not much wiggle room to be had: the money that actually goes to CPB is split according to a mostly statutory formula. For 2015, Congress has budgeted $445 million for CPB. That’s less than 1% of the budget. Way less. It’s about 1/100th of a 1%.</p>

      <title>Don’t Mess With Big Bird</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/dont-mess-with-big-bird</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charles M. Blow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 1969, Big Bird has been the king of the block on “Sesame Street.” When I was a child, he and his friends taught me the alphabet and the colors and how to do simple math. [...] </p>
  
  <p>And, for me, it’s bigger than Big Bird. It’s almost impossible to overstate how instrumental PBS has been in my development and instruction.</p>
  
  <p>We were poor. My mother couldn’t afford day care, and I didn’t go to preschool. My great-uncle took care of me all day. I could watch one hour of television: PBS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never underestimate the power of the intangible in a society, like public television. In a land built on the promise of opportunity, the public goods and services that are there for the benefit of all can truly make an endless difference. </p>

<p>Count me with Mr. Blow when he says: "I honestly don’t know where I would be in the world without PBS."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>As Children's Freedom Has Declined, So Has Their Creativity</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/as-childrens-freedom-has-declined-so-has-their-creativity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Peter Gray, on the continued research about the negative impacts of depriving children of their freedom and autonomy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, surprise, surprise.  For several decades we as a society have been suppressing children’s freedom to ever-greater extents, and now we find that their creativity is declining.</p>
  
  <p>Creativity is nurtured by freedom and stifled by the continuous monitoring, evaluation, adult-direction, and pressure to conform that restrict children’s lives today.  In the real world few questions have one right answer, few problems have one right solution; that’s why creativity is crucial to success in the real world.  But more and more we are subjecting children to an educational system that assumes one right answer to every question and one correct solution to every problem, a system that punishes children (and their teachers too) for daring to try different routes.  We are also, as I documented in a <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201001/the-dramatic-rise-anxiety-and-depression-in-children-and-adolescents-is-it">previous essay</a>, increasingly depriving children of free time outside of school to play, explore, be bored, overcome boredom, fail, overcome failure—that is, to do all that they must do in order to develop their full creative potential.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ira Glass heads back to school to explore grit, what kids need to know, and more, on <em>This American Life</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As kids and teachers head back to school, we wanted to turn away from questions about politics and unions and money and all the regular school stuff people argue about, and turn to something more optimistic — an emerging theory about what to teach kids, from Paul Tough's new book <em>How Children Succeed</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a great episode, and reminds me about how much I love Ira Glass's thoughtful exploration and curiosity. Listen here:</p><div class="sqs-audio-embed"

      <title>'Your Brain on Pseudoscience: The Rise of Popular Neurobollocks'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/your-brain-on-pseudoscience-the-rise-of-popular-neurobollocks</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steven Poole calls bollocks on the popular "neuroscience-explains-life" book genre:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, instead, here is a recipe for writing a hit popular brain book. You start each chapter with a pat anecdote about an individual’s professional or entrepreneurial success, or narrow escape from peril. You then mine the neuroscientific research for an apparently relevant specific result and narrate the experiment, perhaps interviewing the scientist involved and describing his hair. You then climax in a fit of premature extrapolation, inferring from the scientific result a calming bromide about what it is to function optimally as a modern human being. Voilà, a laboratory-sanctioned Big Idea in digestible narrative form.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: a similar formula is equally true – if not moreso – for the parenting book genre and other related commentaries on modern childhood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Who's Really Getting Robbed?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/whos-really-getting-robbed</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Winerip gets straight to the point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only way to save America’s children is to lock up the baby boomers. We are robbing the next generation’s future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except... it's more complicated than that, as Winerip later ventures to explain in his essay. It's an interesting read, and as an exercise it is propelled by the kind of back-and-forth internal dialogue and overall questioning that is needed whenever "the plight of millenials" (and/or their laziness, lack of work ethic, parental clinginess, and general inability to "grow up" – all depending on who you listen to) is considered.</p>

<p>Let's cut straight to the reality here: it is completely a matter of apples-and-oranges thinking to put millenials up against any other generation to compare. Millenials are not like older generations, and are simply never going to be – because <em>the world they've grown up in and now inhabit</em> isn't the same as it was for other generations. In order to even begin to compare generations and examine their differences, you first have to reevaluate the frames of reference you use for such a comparison. And when the world moves so fast, and changes so much, it becomes pretty impossible to establish any kind of meaningful insight into why millenials are the  way they are.</p>

<p>A better question – and the question that at least initially drove the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation">social sciences-rooted generation studies</a> movement – is how the social and economic structures of a society have changed for this new group of individuals. At its best, "generational" thinking and cohort-based research may yield useful insight into the unique cultural contexts and circumstances that those of a specific generation have generally experienced together. When you turn it into this superficial, mass pop-psychology examination of the personity traits and characteristics of all people of a similar age, though, that's little better than relying on race or gender to determine who you think a person is; simply put, it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generationism">institutionalized discrimination</a> – shamelessly brandished under the guise of "research." And it's just plain wrong, any way you slice it.</p>

<p>(And now in other news... Apparently, I'm turning into the "get off my lawn, you darn old people!" character for the millenial generation. Um, okay?)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Kalamazoo, Michigan – the City That Pays for College</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/kalamazoo-michigan-the-city-that-pays-for-college</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An amazing story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back in November 2005, when this year’s graduates were in sixth grade, the superintendent of Kalamazoo’s public schools, Janice M. Brown, shocked the community by announcing that unnamed donors were pledging to pay the tuition at Michigan’s public colleges, universities and community colleges for every student who graduated from the district’s high schools. All of a sudden, students who had little hope of higher education saw college in their future. Called the Kalamazoo Promise, the program — blind to family income levels, to pupils’ grades and even to disciplinary and criminal records — would be the most inclusive, most generous scholarship program in America.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, aren't the only tech titans who were <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/2012/9/maria-montessoris-influence-over-google">raised with a Montessori education</a>; Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, is another. In fact, he mentioned it again briefly during one recent interview about the successful rise of Amazon's Kindle: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Anyone ever tell you that you have a focus problem?</strong> </p>
  
  <p><strong>Bezos:</strong> Hahahaha! That?s so funny because my Montessori teacher used to have to pick me up and move me from one task to the next.</p>

      <title>Thomas Friedman: The New Rules</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/thomas-friedman-new-rules</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Economist and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman on the changed economy, and why proactive learning and creativity is more important than ever – despite what 'the rules' say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of this made me think Obama should stop using the phrase — first minted by Bill Clinton in 1992 — that if you just “work hard and play by the rules” you should expect that the American system will deliver you a decent life and a chance for your children to have a better one. That mantra really resonates with me and, I am sure, with many voters. There is just one problem: It’s out of date.</p>
  
  <p>The truth is, if you want a decent job that will lead to a decent life today you have to work harder, regularly reinvent yourself, obtain at least some form of postsecondary education, make sure that you’re engaged in lifelong learning and play by the rules. That’s not a bumper sticker, but we terribly mislead people by saying otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the one hand, the old economic ways of doing things is out of date – and if it stays the same as it has always been, so is our public education system. On the other, if we can truly reinvent education – make it about creativity and about self-empowered, lifelong learning and inventive thinking – then we can revolutionize the American economy, and make it stronger than it has likely ever been.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why Fathers (Or Their Genes, At Least) Really Matter*</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/why-fathers-or-at-least-their-genes-really-matter</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a recent flurry of scientific studies examining whether men's age might have some effect on whether their children would be born at a greater risk of autism and other mental diseases, here's a more in-depth look and explanation at what the research seems to indicate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Biology is making it clearer by the day that a man’s health and well-being have a measurable impact on his future children’s health and happiness. This is not because a strong, resilient man has a greater likelihood of being a fabulous dad — or not only for that reason — or because he’s probably got good genes. Whether a man’s genes are good or bad (and whatever “good” and “bad” mean in this context), his children’s bodies and minds will reflect lifestyle choices he has made over the years, even if he made those choices long before he ever imagined himself strapping on a Baby Bjorn.</p>
  
  <p>Doctors have been telling men for years that smoking, drinking and recreational drugs can lower the quality of their sperm. What doctors should probably add is that the health of unborn children can be affected by what and how much men eat; the toxins they absorb; the traumas they endure; their poverty or powerlessness; and their age at the time of conception. In other words, what a man needs to know is that his life experience leaves biological traces on his children. Even more astonishingly, those children may pass those traces along to their children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's a lot in here that occasionally comes across as biological determinism – the social environment matters a great deal too, you know – but it's interesting to examine the intergenerational links between parents' pre-baby lifestyles and social contexts and the later health and well-being of their children. It's so easy to think of raising children as a relatively simple and clear-cut thing – but the reality is anything but. (And now there's SCIENCE! to back that up.)</p>

<p>If you don't want to get lost in the science of it, though, look at it like this: One of the best ways to make sure your kids are living a happy, healthy life is to make sure you're living one, too; that's true before you have kids, and its possibly even more true afterward. So go out and live a good life, so that your kids can live one too.</p>

<p><em>* And, yeah, there's a great deal more that matters beyond simply a father's genes. It's just nice to have a snappy headline every once in awhile.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>More Hulabaloo about Cheating in Schools</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/more-hulabaloo-about-cheating-in-schools</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Large-scale cheating has been uncovered over the last year at some of the nation’s most competitive schools, like Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, the Air Force Academy and, most recently, Harvard.</p>
  
  <p>Studies of student behavior and attitudes show that a majority of students violate standards of academic integrity to some degree, and that high achievers are just as likely to do it as others. Moreover, there is evidence that the problem has worsened over the last few decades.</p>
  
  <p>Experts say the reasons are relatively simple: Cheating has become easier and more widely tolerated, and both schools and parents have failed to give students strong, repetitive messages about what is allowed and what is prohibited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"The reasons are fairly simple?" The reasons are fairly simple? What the-? You mean the only reason students cheat is because it's "easier" to do now? There's nothing else compelling them to cheat – they cheat just because they can?</p>

<p>Also: "Strong, repetitive messages" is exactly what students <em>do</em> get during each school day – and too much of, at that. Students don't need blunt repetition – they need stuff that engages them. "Education" actually tends to take care of itself when you just follow that engagement.</p>

<p>But I'll hold off on lamenting the follies of testing further – because educator Alfie Kohn has really written the book on this one. <a href="http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/cheating.htm">Here's what Kohn begins by saying, in one of his signature-style, long-form essays on education</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An article about cheating practically writes itself. It must begin, of course, with a shocking statistic or two to demonstrate the pervasiveness of the problem, perhaps accompanied by a telling anecdote or a quotation from a shrugging student (“Well, sure, everyone does it”). This would be followed by a review of different variants of unethical behavior and a look at who is most likely to cheat. Finally, a list of ideas must be provided for how we can deter or catch cheaters, along with a stern call for greater vigilance.</p>
  
  <p>Just about everyone agrees that cheating is bad and that we need to take steps to prevent it. But it is precisely this overwhelming consensus that makes me uneasy. Whenever a conclusion seems so obvious and is accepted so uncritically, it’s probably time to take a fresh look.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And take a fresh look he does. I think his title sums it all up best; it's time for us to really ask ourselves, "Just who is cheating whom here?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Paul Tough on Opting Out of the 'Rug Rat Race'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/paul-tough-on-opting-out-of-the-rug-rat-race</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An excerpt from the great new book by Paul Tough, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0547564651/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=danielsaurusrex-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0547564651">"How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity and the Hidden Power of Character"</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>American children, especially those who grow up in relative comfort, are, more than ever, shielded from failure as they grow up. They certainly work hard; they often experience a great deal of pressure and stress; but in reality, their path through the education system is easier and smoother than it was for any previous generation. Many of them are able to graduate from college without facing any significant challenges. But if this new research is right, their schools, their families, and their culture may all be doing them a disservice by not giving them more opportunities to struggle. Overcoming adversity is what produces character. And character, even more than IQ, is what leads to real and lasting success.</p>

      <title>Using RFID Tags to Track Children's Attendance at School</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/using-rfid-tags-to-track-childrens-attendance-at-school</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Kravets for Wired, on what some schools are now doing to keep track of attendance: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was only a matter of time. Radio frequency identification devices are a daily part of the electronic age, and are fast becoming a part of passports, libraries and payment cards, and are widely expected to replace bar-code labels on consumer goods.</p>
  
  <p>And it appears that the educational move to Big Brother-style monitoring is motivated mainly by money, despite privacy and health concerns.</p>
  
  <p>Two schools at the Northside Independent School District in San Antonio began issuing the RFID-chip-laden student-body cards when classes began last Monday. Like most state-financed schools, their budgets are tied to average daily attendance. If a student is not in his seat during morning roll call, the district doesn’t receive daily funding for that pupil, because the school has no way of knowing for sure if the student is there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that's just messed up on so many levels. Whatever happened to trust within education? How can we expect children to learn if their schools don't even trust them to show up? And how can schools and teachers do their jobs – and trust children – if we, in turn, don't trust them?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A Boy Grows Close To His Grandmother Through Memories</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/boy-grows-close-to-grandmother-through-memories</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A touching anecdote collected by NPR's <a href="http://www.npr.org/series/4516989/storycorps">StoryCorps</a>, about a grandson's remembrance of his grandmother – who died tragically in the World Trade Center attacks on September 11th. It's really an honest moment, and inspiring in a way. As one commenter put it: "I love the way Story Corps lets us slip into little pockets of people's lives. I feel like I'm being let in on a secret every time I listen."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ordinary People and Hope</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/ordinary-people-and-hope</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Andrew Sullivan's readers writes in to respond to criticism of President Obama's convention speech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish that the pundits would watch these speeches with ordinary people. Last night I watched the speech with a gathering of about 50 people, from junior-high age to seniors. Everyone loved the speech. The most important thing for me from his speech was that he was challenging us to be grown ups and offering a vision of a people who are united and proud of the contributions they make to each other. [...] Last night you heard a President tell a nation that they must be tough, work hard, and contribute to something greater than themselves. You heard a President tell us that our founding values and the sacrifices of generations demanded that we be good citizens. You heard a President express his love for his people regardless of party or ideology. [...] </p>
  
  <p>My middle son watched the speech with me and was cheering because he sees in our President a person who is a role model and that gives him hope. He signed up to phone bank. My oldest son texted me to say that the speech was incredible and that he was moved by the way that he brought us back to hope - a mature hope that is grounded in service to others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't recall another president in recent past who has been as much of a role model to young people as Barack Obama has today. Political views aside, screw the pundits and politicians who say that the young people who turned out in force in 2008 are simply not going to care anymore because they don't have jobs. What draws our admiration of Obama is something much deeper than that; it's about values and optimism over the long haul, and more than anything it's about desiring to do good and help others – to leave the world a little better off, rather than just care about ourselves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's "an unofficial audio tour" of the Museum of Modern Art in NYC, narrated solely by kids (via <a href="http://kottke.org/12/09/moma-audio-tours-narrated-by-kids">Kottke</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each piece of art is analyzed by experts aged 3-10, as they share their unique, unfiltered perspective on such things as composition, the art's deeper meaning, and why some stuff's so weird looking. This is Modern Art without the pretentiousness, the pomposity, or any other big "p" words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My short response:</strong> Now <em>that's</em> how you look at art.</p>

<p><strong>My real response:</strong> As cool as this is, I would have loved for the audio clips to be longer, and the children given more opportunity to think about and explain the paintings. An approach like <a href="http://vtshome.org">Visual Thinking Strategies</a> could've been employed perfectly here; believe it or not, children <em>are</em> capable of incredible in-depth thinking and articulation, and I sometimes wonder if these 'soundbite'-y sorts of projects only perpetuate an expectation for adults not to take children too seriously.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>John Dewey's Persistent Vision of Learning as Freedom</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/an-ongoing-vision-of-learning-as-freedom</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The philosopher John Dewey, America’s most influential thinker on education, opposed this effort [to separate students into vocational training and broader-based education]. Though he was open to integrating manual training in school curriculums, Dewey opposed the dual-track system because he recognized that it would reinforce the inequalities of his time. Wouldn’t such a system have the same result today?</p>
  
  <p>To be sure, Dewey recognized the necessity of gainful employment. “The world in which most of us live is a world in which everyone has a calling and occupation, something to do,” he wrote. “Some are managers and others are subordinates. But the great thing for one as for the other is that each shall have had the education which enables him to see within his daily work all there is in it of large and human significance.”</p>
  
  <p>Education should aim to enhance our capacities, Dewey argued, so that we are not reduced to mere tools. “The kind of vocational education in which I am interested is not one which will ‘adapt’ workers to the existing industrial regime; I am not sufficiently in love with the regime for that.” Are we?</p>
  
  <p>Who wants to attend school to learn to be “human capital”? Who aspires for their children to become economic or military resources? Dewey had a different vision. Given the pace of change, it is impossible (he noted in 1897) to know what the world will be like in a couple of decades, so schools first and foremost should teach us habits of learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">Ken Robinson, in 2006</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue -- despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days -- what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazing, I think, that for how much things change, the real issues remain exactly as they were a hundred years ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"Once I Get That Call, Everything Changes."</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/once-i-get-that-call-everything-changes</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Samuel Weinstein, a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon, shares what it's like to give a child a new heart:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are certainly more difficult procedures in congenital cardiac surgery to perform than a heart transplant, but few freighted with more anticipation. After all, the heart that we are asking to sustain our patient started off this morning in another child. The transplant cardiologist who has been taking care of this child for the last year meets us in the O.R. at 4:15 a.m. “How is it going?” she asks.</p>
  
  <p>After the heart is sewn in and we allow it to be perfused with blood, it starts to beat. Within 30 minutes, it is beating strongly enough that the patient can come off the heart-lung machine. The boy is on his own.</p>

      <title>Maria Montessori's Influence Over Google</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/maria-montessoris-influence-over-google</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Google honors the legacy of educator Maria Montessori with one of their special homepage doodles. In fact, it's fairly well known that Google's two co-founders attended Montessori schools during their childhoods – and that upbringing may have had more of an influence over who they would become, and the company they would found, than you may realize. Marissa Mayer shares further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You can’t understand Google unless you know that both Larry and Sergey were Montessori kids,” Levy explained. “She’s referring to schools based on the education philosophy of Maria Montessori, an Italian physician born in 1870 who believed that children should be allowed the freedom to pursue their interests.”</p>
  
  <p>“In a Montessori school, you go paint because you have something to express or you just want to do it that afternoon, not because the teacher said so,” articulated Mayer. “This is baked into how Larry and Sergey approach problems. They’re always asking, why should it be like that? It’s the way their brains were programmed early on.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look around at the people changing the world and I guarantee you those will be the misfits and rebels, the ones who dropped out of high school or never attended a "real" one to begin with. To steal a quip from Apple and Steve Jobs, to think differently requires that you be educated differently, too.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>This is Why You Should Love Actor Jon Hamm</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/this-is-why-you-should-love-actor-jon-hamm</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talking with GQ about the DVD release of the film <em>Friends with Kids</em>, in which he plays "a pretty regular dude of unfortunate circumstance: unhappily married with kids":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>GQ:</strong> There's a video of you giving advice to young girls, but what's the most important piece of wisdom you'd share with a son?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Jon Hamm:</strong> I don't know, honestly. Boys are obviously very different than girls. I used to be a teacher, and herding eighth grade children around a classroom is tricky enough, but boys are particularly tricky. So mostly my advice is just to stop talking and be nicer, because they can be both loud and super, super annoying. I don't know...I'm from the Midwest—being polite goes a long way with me.</p>

    <span>&#147;</span>Cajuns teach fearlessness to their children, which is the opposite of what you experience in the Northeast, where people are raising children in a fear based culture of phrases like, ‘don’t cross the street alone’ and ‘don’t talk to that person.’ If you drive by casually in Southern Louisiana, you will see children running around alone, but that’s part of a plan. This region breeds the strongest people. They are so brave, and they have to be in order to live in that region. I am really in awe of that.<span>&#148;</span>

      <title>Business Leaders Say It's Time to Re-Think the U.S. Education System</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/business-leaders-say-its-time-to-re-think-the-us-education-system</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tammy Erickson for the Harvard Business Review: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several years ago I heard the noted economist Lester Thurow ask an audience to name the greatest invention in U.S. history. Hum. . . The light bulb? Telegraph? Cotton gin? Polio vaccine? Frozen food? Sliced bread?</p>
  
  <p>None of these. Thurow argued that the most significant invention in U.S. history was the public education system established in the early days of the industrial revolution. When U.S. textile owners recognized the need for an educated workforce and forced through legislation requiring young people to attend school, the U.S. created, he argues, its single greatest asset. Education that was paid for the by taxation, compulsory to everyone, and free at the point of delivery, was a revolutionary idea. [...]</p>
  
  <p>The model worked well for 100 years because it matched between the needs of employers. But, as we all know, most of the jobs of tomorrow will not be industrial jobs. Even those in the manufacturing sector will require a knowledge-based set of skills and behaviors. The gap between the output of our educational system and the job demands of the current century is enormous — and growing wider. And the kids intuitively recognize the gap. They're asking for a change.</p>

      <title>Adults Again Get Their Underwear Into Knots Over a High Schooler's Graduation Speech</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/adults-again-get-their-underwear-into-knots-over-a-high-schoolers-graduation-speech</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Garrett Epps in The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there's one belief that unites Americans, it's that First Amendment freedom of speech is a good thing.  Everybody should have it: cigarette companies, SuperPACs, hate groups, Todd Akin, Cher, and Nichole Ritchie.</p>
  
  <p>Teenagers, not so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things get even more ridiculous when you read about why this Oklahoma high school valedictorian was reprimanded for a speech she gave at her graduation, and is now having her diploma witheld until she apologizes. (Epps later provides what might just be the best explanation for it all: "Anyone who's ever been in high school knows that some people are drawn to education because they enjoy petty power over people who can't fight back.")</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"Take Them For What They Are"</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/take-them-for-what-they-are</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maurice Sendak, in <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/05/09/grim-colberty-tales-maurice-sendak/">what would fatefully become</a> his last public interview before he died:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COLBERT: What’s the best thing a parent can do for a child?</p>
  
  <p>SENDAK: Love him, or her.</p>
  
  <p>COLBERT: What does that mean?</p>
  
  <p>SENDAK: Take them for what they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to admit, I subconsciously knew this was one of the last things he said publicly, but it didn't really sink in until Lori Pickert <a href="http://www.whiteoakschool.com/camp-creek-blog/2012/5/10/take-them-for-what-they-are.html">pointed it out</a>. It's honestly just too perfect for words – and so befitting the man and his legacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Let Your Kids Do Stupid Things. And Let Yourself Do Them, Too.</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/on-taking-risks-and-making-mistakes-essential-experiences-for-kids-psychology-today</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peggy Drexler has an essay I've been sitting on for quite a while. An author and psychologist who focuses on gender and family issues, she wrote a column several months ago that was passionate and effective plea for why we should let our children take risks and make mistakes. It's <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-gender-ourselves/201208/taking-risks-and-making-mistakes-essential-experiences-kids">well worth reading</a>, it should go without saying, and it addresses the sensitive balance that we need to strike when supporting children's in their mistakes: reliable and observant, though not interfering. Comfortable with uncertainty and patient with children's timing. Encouraging of their exploration, while providing an emotional safety to return to. Drexler's essay ends with mismatched socks – but all the while, it left me curious about <em>why</em> we as adults are so uncomfortable with children's need to take risks and make mistakes, even as we might match up those same needs with a different importance and understanding in our own lives.</p>

<p>Maybe this isn't true for everybody: but I think most of us (adults, that is) inherently recognize that there is something necessary – and perhaps even virtuous – about challenging yourself. About making mistakes to learn from, about testing hypotheses about situations, and about taking risks, physically, intellectually, and socially. These are essential experiences in most of our lives, and deep down I think many of us recognize the role they play in living a happy and contented life. </p>

<p>So where is it along the way, in the crazy process of growing up, that so many of us adults forget these apply to children just as equally? Do we really tell ourselves that kids shouldn't face problems, or be allowed to summon their own strength and courage and face their problems independently? When did our "grown up" experiences of risktaking and challenge suddenly become so separate, so manifestly different from what they were like when we were kids? We just don't seem to connect the two anymore; it's like the distance between children's risktaking and the risktaking of adults is miles apart, so wide in fact that we've completely forgotten all of the feelings of what it was like before. How have we gotten to this point?</p>

<p>I really don't know. </p>

<p>I have a hunch, though. I think that this illusion of separation first begins to take hold when we stop living our lives alongside our children, and focus instead on managing their own lives. Instead of embracing the serendipitous with children, we run off to the bookshelf first to see what Dr. Spock and ther other "child experts" say about it. We get caught up in the Parenting Magazine version of how our children's lives "need to" be. We trap ourselves in questioning whether we're being a "good parent." And we cling fiercely to the "childhood" we think is right.</p>

<p>All the while, children are living their lives without us, right before our eyes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Myth of the Reluctant Learner</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/the-myth-of-the-reluctant-learner</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lori Pickert:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No child is reluctant to learn. Every child strives to learn as much as he can. There are only children who are strongly resistant to being told what to learn and how to learn it. There are children who are more stubborn about being forced to learn things that don’t interest them or don’t seem useful. There are children who are less able to tolerate boredom and children who are less able to tolerate sitting still for long periods of time trying to focus on something that has no importance or meaning to them.</p>
  
  <p>It is both inaccurate and unfair to label a child resistant to a style of learning (e.g., sedentary, authoritative) as a reluctant learner. When we do so, we’re reinforcing the issue as an educational or intellectual one. We’re saying, “Hey you, you’re bad at learning.” Does that help the problem or exacerbate it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So spot on. Read the whole thing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mitt Romney's Education Plan and the Dangers of the Privatization Trend</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/the-bomb-hidden-in-mitt-romneys-education-plan</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To put the trend toward <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/?tag=education%20privatization">education privatization</a> into further perspective, this piece by Matthew Yglesias in May 2012 offers a thorough look at the hidden dangers and highly politicalized nature of opening up education dollars for use by anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>This is certainly not to say that only public schools and educators are going to have all the answers – or that they're the only place that will yield "better" educations. I think we do need to take a good, hard look at the underlying motivations that drive such "education reformers," though, before we bite onto what they offer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Father’s Age a Reason for Autism and Schizophrenia?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/fathers-age-a-reason-for-autism-and-schizophrenia</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benedict Carey, reporting for the New York Times on a new scientific study that may provide a clue to the rising number of autism cases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Older men are more likely than young ones to father a child who develops autism or schizophrenia, because of random mutations that become more numerous with advancing paternal age, scientists reported on Wednesday, in the first study to quantify the effect as it builds each year. The age of mothers had no bearing on the risk for these disorders, the study found.</p>

      <title>Returning 'Baby Veronica' to Her Native American Tribe</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/returning-baby-veronica-to-her-native-american-tribe</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marcia Zug, a law professor writing for Slate, offers a compelling look at a recent, sensationalized adoption story from South Carolina: that of Veronica, a young 2-year-old Cherokee Indian child who was adopted at birth and returned to her biological father earlier this year by the state, despite protest from her adoptive parents. </p>

<p>The adoptive parents, who had Veronica for nearly two years, have been fighting fiercely to regain custody of her since she was returned – bringing incredible media attention to the case in the process. On July 26, though, the South Carolina Supreme Court  affirmed the decision for her return, citing how Veronica's initial adoption was in clear violation of a federal statute known as the Indian Child Welfare Act.</p>

<p>This case may seem tragic – yet as Zug later explains, it is heartwrenching in more ways than one. As tragic as the experience may be for the adoptive family, the South Carolina Supreme Court was also absolutely right in its decision. In order to understand why, though, you have to know and understand the Indian Child Welfare Act. And for that, you should read this article. </p>

<p>It's a tough thing to have a kid placed in a scenario like this – but the world is a messy place, and when you place things like this within the context of history and the law, you realize we often just have to live with it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's another education tactic to file away under 'Trying to Solve the Wrong Problem in the Wrong Way, for the Wrong Reason': in this case, a public middle school in West Virginia is now facing a lawsuit brought on by the American Civil Liberties Union for allegedly practicing gender discrimination, based on how it sets up and implements instruction within the school's same-sex classrooms. </p>

<p>Abigail Pesta, writing for The Daily Beast, reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The suit, filed on behalf of a mother of three daughters who attend the school, contends, among other things, that the school lights its classrooms more brightly for boys than for girls—and encourages boys to move around freely throughout the day and girls to sit quietly and share their feelings.</p>
  
  <p>“The school is dividing kids based on reproductive organs,” says Amy Katz, an attorney working with the ACLU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While same-sex classrooms are legal in America – and have been growing in number since 2006, when many federal restrictions against them were relaxed – they are not without controversy. Proponents argue that teaching boys and girls separately allows educators to more fully address what they see as issues that are gender-specific to students – in so doing helping all children "reach their full potential." Opponents, however, argue that their practices are based on little more than pseudoscience and gender stereotypes, and perpetuate sexism. Pesta covers the issue well, and to be sure there are valid opinions on both sides.</p>

<p>That said, this is so astoundingly, overwhelmingly an example of solving the wrong problem in the wrong way, for the wrong reasons. All children are different; gender is just one aspect of this, and it is largely a socially constructed one at that (but we'll get into that later). Rather than having an education system that separates children because of their differences, how infinitely richer it would be to have schools that not only welcomed but celebrated these differences – embracing each child as an individual, with a pedagogy that draws upon their strengths and doesn't limit their education to just "the way boys learn" and "the way girls learn". How about we make it instead about "the way Jacob learns, and the way Suzy learns, and the way John learns"?</p>

<p>Gender's not the problem here: it's the pedagogy that's the problem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>U.S. Kids Increasingly Opting for Diet Soda Drinks, 'Just Like Mom And Dad'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/us-kids-increasingly-opting-for-diet-soda-drinks-just-like-mom-and-dad</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NPR reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, consumption of diet drinks has doubled among U.S. children over a decade. About 1 in 4 of adults drink low-calorie or no-calorie sweetened drinks and foods. And for children: Six percent were consuming diet drinks in 1999-2000. This increased to 12.5 percent in 2007-2008. The findings were recently published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the surface, it's certainly an interesting trend. More importantly, though, I think it highlights the importance of not treating children's health and childhood obesity as a separate issue from the rest of society. The reality is children's health is most closely correlated with their parents' health: parents that are active and eat (and drink) healthily have children who are active and healthy as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>As Technology is Further Embraced in Education, Corporations Inevitably Find Ways to Profit From It</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/profiting-from-education</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Try to contain yourself, as you consider the staggering extent to which corporations have managed to embed themselves in education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then there is the Walt Disney Company. It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article, by Brooks Barnes and Amy Chozick for the New York Times, looks at the burgeoning opening that private, for-profit, corporations and technology and entertainment companies have found to garner dollars from school districts for digital textbooks and educational content. They continue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion.</p>
  
  <p>Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While technologies like the iPad might end up being good for classrooms overall, and content deals like this appear enticing in the short-term, ultimately this trend can only lead to <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/?tag=education%20privatization">such a level of the privatization of education</a> that the pursuit of profit ultimately derails and distracts from the real reason for education. Education is not and should not be treated as a profit maker, a loss leader, or a training ground for future corporate consumers; education is about individual children as learners. It's that simple.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Misplaced Mondays, August 20th Edition</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/misplaced-mondays-1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting, well, today, we have a new feature here at Danielsaurus: the “everything we forgot to post this past week and are too attention-deficit to go back and post this week, but should probably share anyway” feature. It’s a round-up of stories from the past few weeks that might've gone overlooked or underappreciated – or perhaps just forgotten, but are definitely still worth your while. This gives me no excuse now not to link to more things, so I hope you enjoy the added bits of delight every Monday.</p>

<p>Here you go!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Just another princess movie?</strong> <a href="http://5by5.tv/incomparable/102">A geeky discussion on the 5by5 podcast network</a> on what Pixar’s new film “Brave” – and Disney’s many past princess movies – say <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/just-another-princess-movie/">about female characters in animation and film in general</a>.</p>

<p>Via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bellellied/posts/429252833793093">Bellelli Educación</a>, <a href="http://www.melindawenner.com/Clips_files/MiQ109Wenn2p.pdf">a 2009 article in Scientific American</a> explores how <strong>children use more sophisticated language when playing with other children</strong> than when playing with adults.</p>

<p><strong>In your twenties, gay, and settled in your relationship? Bring on the baby expectations.</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/us/gay-couples-face-pressure-to-have-children.html?pagewanted=all">Nowadays, even gay couples are facing the pressure to have children</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Having iPads in the classroom raises math scores by 49%</strong>, according to <a href="http://www.eschoolnews.com/2012/06/27/kipp-academy-flips-the-8th-grade-math-classroom-using-yourteacher-on-the-ipad/">one program evaluation</a> (Via <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/13/ipads-in-the-classroom-raise-math-scores-49/">Loop Insight</a>). You could probably argue this has more to do with the <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/flipped-classroom-best-practices-andrew-miller">Flipped Classroom pedagogy</a> behind it, but nonetheless it’s a stirring example of how technology can be used to empower children as learners.</p>

<p>A flashback to the past: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2012/aug/12/from-the-archive-junk-playground-1953?newsfeed=true">a 1953 report in the UK’s Observer</a> on <strong>how two of London’s adventure playgrounds are giving children a much-needed space for youthful adventure</strong>.</p>

<p>Capitalizing on the famed director’s birthday, Maria Popova shares <strong><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/08/13/happy-birthday-hitchcock-how-the-iconic-director-changed-one-boys-life/">how Alfred Hitchcock made an indelible impact on one young boy’s life</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How do you make the decision about when your child is old enough for his or her first cellphone?</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/technology/personaltech/weighing-when-a-child-is-old-enough-for-a-cellphone.html?emc=tnt&amp;tntemail1=y">It’s a tricky issue.</a> I should comment on this separately, but I’ll take a stab here anyway: while the article suggests avoiding smartphones for specialized “family”-based phones, I’d argue for the exact opposite: giving a kid a GPS-enabled smartphone, like the iPhone, opens up a world of geographic exploration and mobility. Mike Lanza has <a href="http://playborhood.com/2010/06/give_mobile_phones_to_tweens_then_let_them_roam/">a great piece on this exact issue over at Playborhood</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.brothers-brick.com/2012/08/10/mission-to-mars-an-interview-with-stephen-pakbaz/">Build with LEGO, send a Rover to Mars</a></strong>. A great interview with Stephen Pakbaz, one of the designers of the Curiosity rover, reflecting on his LEGO-filled childhood. Via <a href="http://io9.com/5933865/behold-a-lego-curiosity-rover-built-by-a-designer-of-the-real-curiosity?tag=thisisawesome">This is Awesome</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, if you weren’t convinced already, Glenda Cooper makes <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/9455881/Tiger-mums-its-best-to-underparent.html">a very good argument for why you should ditch helicopter parenting</a></strong> in exchange for something a little less drastic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"Come off it, folks: how many paedophiles can there be?"</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/come-off-it-folks-how-many-paedophiles-can-there-be</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quite amazingly, that rather forthright declaration is the real title of an op-ed in England's The Telegraph newspaper, published originally in 2006. The op-ed's author? None other than Boris Johnson, now the Mayor of London. He was asked to move seats while on a British Airways flight because he was sitting next to two kids – his <em>own</em>, ironically, though the stewardess didn't realize this at first. And as Johnson highights, he hasn't been the only adult male unjustifiably accused of pedophilia, simply by virtue of being around children.</p>

<p>Johnson might be a loveably daft fellow most days, but his perspective is spot on in this case – his outrage aptly justified, in my humble opinion. This preoccupation that both American and British societies have with pedophilia – which continues to be ungrounded in any statistical reality – really does just puzzle my mind, and more concertingly detracts from actual efforts to prevent real child abuse. If only more of us would take the time, as Johnson did, to call out the hysteria for what it is: an unfounded, unhelpful moral panic.</p>

      <title>Gender-Variant Girls Dress Down, Gender-Variant Boys Dress Up?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/gender-variant-children-continue-to-confound</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sociologist Lisa Wade, writing for the <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/">Sociological Images blog</a>, examines the imagery accompanying <a href="http://danielsaurus.com/2012/8/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress">Ruth Padawer's recent piece</a> in the New York Times Magazine about gender-variant children. She especially singles out an interesting aspect of the boys featured in the article: they not only dress as girls, but seem to have sought out a hyperfeminized – even somewhat sexualized – version of girl dress and behavior:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, girls, when they enact a tomboy role — and now I’m off into speculation-land — don’t seem to go so far into the weeds.  We don’t see girls dressing up like lumberjacks or business men in suits and ties.  They don’t do tomman, they do tomboy.  There’s something more woman about how some of these boys perform femininity.</p>
  
  <p>Some research on tomboys shows that girls who adopt it are sometimes, in part, trying to put off the sexual attention that comes with growing up.  So perhaps tomboyism is a way of rejecting one’s maturing body.  In contrast, perhaps femininity appeals to some boys because we adultify and sexualize young girls; it’s a form of grown up play as well as gender deviance?</p>

      <title>Spending the Family Vacation Volunteering</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/spending-the-family-vacation-on-a-volunteer-trip</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A look at when families decide to go on "volunteer trips" together – consciously spending their vacation immersed in a different, usually impoverished culture, volunteering to serve others. While there are issues to consider with such trips, they can also go a long way toward raising socially conscious children:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Ms. Everson’s view, the trip was a success. “My daughters are growing up in a very privileged town,” she said. “This trip was a chance for us, as a family, to play a global role in helping others while also expanding our worldview.” [...]</p>
  
  <p>Without exception, all of the children interviewed spoke of the lasting impact their travels have had on them. Some wanted to pursue jobs in international public service; others were interested in emergency medicine. “Kids get such a bad rap for being selfish and spoiled these days,” Mrs. Deyo said. “But if you do something that helps shift their perspective, it is unbelievable how they rise to the occasion.”</p>

      <title>Feds Seek Action Against Mississippi's 'School-to-Prison Pipeline'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/the-feds-go-after-mississippis-school-to-prison-pipeline</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Lauderdale County, Mississippi, of violating students' rights by not giving them an opportunity for due process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Officials in Lauderdale County, Mississippi, have operated "a school-to-prison pipeline" that violates the constitutional rights of juveniles by incarcerating them for alleged school disciplinary infractions, some as minor as defiance, the U.S. Department of Justice said Friday. "Students most affected by this system are African-American children and children with disabilities," the Justice Department said. [...]</p>
  
  <p>"The systematic disregard for children's basic constitutional rights by agencies with a duty to protect and serve these children betrays the public trust," Thomas E. Perez, assistant U.S. attorney general, said in a statement. "We hope to resolve the concerns outlined in our findings in a collaborative fashion, but we will not hesitate to take appropriate legal action if necessary."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lauderdale County's "school-to-prison" pipeline has been the subject of a consistent stream of criticism over the years, as well as a federal class-action lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2009 that alleged that "children and teens were subjected to 'shockingly inhumane' treatment." Amongst other rights violations that the County was found at fault for, police officials within the schools used pepper spray and Mace on students as punishment for infractions as minor as "talking too much".</p>

<p>Needless to say, it's great to see that the feds are taking action against such a corrupt and violent system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sam Soffes on How To Learn</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/sam-soffes-on-how-to-learn</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you learn? By doing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning a bunch of stuff before trying to do is useless. The college approach is worthless. Let's say you spent 4 years learning computer science, graduated, and then tried to make an app. Now you are going to do this same thing. Learn as you go for the things you don't already know. [...]</p>
  
  <p>When you get started with something new, you'll suck at it. That's okay. No one knows everything or is good the first time they do something. This is normal. Don't get discouraged. You're making something. The process alone should be exciting. Once you make something, no matter how simple it is, you've made something!</p>

  <p>One example is the research about the brain's neuroplasticity and the opportunities we have as educators to help students literally change their brains -- and intelligence. To become a teacher without understanding the implications of brain-changing neuroplasticity is a great loss to teachers and their future students. </p>
  
  <p>Beyond understanding the brain's neuroplastic response to stimulation -- how activation and use of memory networks makes them stronger -- future teachers need to recognize how stress inhibits neuroplasticity. It is only when information is processed in the brain's reflective, cognitive prefrontal cortex that new learning can be incorporated into networks of long-term, conceptual memory.</p>

      <title>Century of the Child: Growing By Design</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/century-of-the-child-growing-by-design</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/centuryofthechild/#/" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/501c8d6b24ac0a1285ed8244/501c8d6b24ac0a1285ed8259/5026ec53e4b0010dc9718e93/1344728154106/centuryofthechild.png" alt=""/></a>
  

<p>Exploring the material worlds of childhood from 1900-2000, the Museum of Modern Art's new exhibit is a real treasure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did the 20th century live up to what Swedish design reformer adn social theorist Ellen Key, writing in 1900, envisaged as “the century of the child”? <em>Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900-2000</em> takes both its title and its launching point from Key’s landmark book, which predicted a new preoccupation with the rights, development, and well-being of children; Key argued for progressive design as the means of shaping children’s experience of living in a rapidly changing world. Arranged in seven sections, this exhibition and website tracks the confluence of modern design and modern childhood, presenting individual and collective visions for the material world of children, from utopian dreams for the citizens of the future to the dark realities of political conflict and exploitation.</p>
  
  <p>A diverse array of ideas, practitioners, and objects illustrates how progressive design has informed the physical, intellectual, and emotional development of children and, conversely, how models of children’s play and pedagogy have inspired experimental design. Toys and books, playgrounds and schools, political propaganda and therapeutic products – all are brought together here in a kaleidoscopic narrative that remaps an international history of modern design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you happen to be in New York this summer, do check it out. Meanwhile, the rest of us will have to content ourselves with the exhibit's <a href="http://www.momastore.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10451&amp;productId=139042&amp;promoCode=8H104&amp;categoryId=11486&amp;parent_category_rn=26683&amp;cm_mmc=MoMA-_-Other-_-Exhibitions-_-NA">printed catalogue</a> and – utterly terrific – <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/centuryofthechild/#/">website</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Teaching and Raising Disobedient Children</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/teaching-and-raising-disobedient-children</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>Disobedience is not an issue if obedience is not the goal.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; Daron Quinlan</figcaption>
</figure><p>Tom Hobson – or as he is better known, <a href="http://teachertomsblog.blogspot.com">Teacher Tom</a> – has been writing online for a long time, using his blog as a continual reflection on the more philosophical aspects of a life shared with a bunch of three- and four-year-olds. His writings have always struck me me as a sort of encapsulation of the universe: not only, though, has Teacher Tom's blog been an outlet for exploring the joys of life through the eyes of the young, who are experiencing it afresh, vividly and directly – but it is a testament to what adults can learn and discover about the world through children. In Teacher Tom's world, adults and children alike take an active and equal part in this discovery.</p>

<p>It's posts like this one – entitled <a href="http://teachertomsblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-to-make-adults-who-will-not-be.html">'How to Make Adults Who Will Not Be Pushed Around'</a> – where Tom really gets to to the heart of the matter of life with children, though. As he begins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have never been interested in obedient children. They tend to either grow into rebellious teens who are a danger to themselves as they try to "make up for" all that time spent living under a regimen of artificially repressed urges, or perhaps worse, obedient adults who are a danger to the rest of us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think we consider enough the longer-term impacts of our actions when we teach and parent children. As adults, we have extraordinary power over them – almost undoubtedly undeserved power, most of the time, but power we have to consider and contend with nonetheless. If we don't think about how we use and manage this power, and about how we can keep it from monopolizing our interactions with children, we run a great risk in the kinds of messages we send them about life. </p>

<p>In the stories, the real heroes are always the ones who don't seek out power: they have it forced on them, with untold responsibilities along with it – and in the good stories, the hero's struggle is never really against the villain, but about the unchecked abuse of his or her power. In the end, the successful heroes find a way to put it back in the hands of the people – back in the hands of whom it really belongs. I think the same could be said for us as teachers and parents.</p>

<p>As Tom continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a teacher, I am always looking for ways to give away whatever power is implied by that title, to let the children be in charge of their own learning, of their own bodies, of their own small society. I want them to make the "right" decisions, not because I've told them so, but because they have learned through experience that it is the right decision. I want them to know that they are always responsible for their own behavior. I want them to know that their feelings, their thoughts, and their opinions are just as important as anyone else's. I want them to know, most of all, that this is true even for people with who are stronger, more powerful or wealthier. I want them to grow to be adults who make their own decisions and will not be pushed around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is foolish to pretend that we don't have power over children as adults. But we also have to recognize that we're only temporary guardians of this power – and in time it will slip out of our grasp and find its way into others' hands. Far better to give it away before that, in a way that respects and empowers children – letting them grow into the capable and competent adults the world needs – than to let ourselves become corrupted by that power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Risk and Reward in Nature Play</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/risk-and-reward-in-nature-play</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Finch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bottom line:  children need risk. It is a powerful catalyst for growth that helps them develop good judgment, persistence, courage, resiliency, and self-confidence. “Can I make it across the stream on that log?” “Should I climb one branch higher than I did yesterday?” “Can I jump from that boulder to the next one?” “Why yes, I can – because I’ve tried it and succeeded!” Remove risk from children’s lives, and parts of their growth may stagnate. As adults, we face risks every day – most routine, but some bigger. To deal with these risks, we use judgment which we’ve honed through years of practice, success, and failure. In effect, we go through our days making an enduring series of minor risk/benefit analyses, ranging from whether or not to eat that tempting donut to whether or not to slide through the bothersome yellow light.</p>
  
  <p>However, kids are not born with the gift of informed judgment, nor with awareness of their own abilities and weaknesses. Instead, they learn their capabilities, their vulnerabilities, and their good decision-making skills through real life experiences – sometimes happy, sometimes harsh, but always instructive. Ultimately, a child can practice and learn good judgment by climbing trees at age eight, or that can wait until they are 16 and behind the wheel of a car. Either way, that learning must occur if a child is to be well-equipped to face the on-going dangers and challenges of adult life.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don't come across science like this every day:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An artificial “brain” built by a 17-year-old whiz kid from Florida is able to accurately assess tissue samples for signs of breast cancer, providing more confidence to a minimally invasive procedure. [...] </p>
  
  <p>“I taught the computer how to diagnose breast cancer,” Brittany Wenger, the Lakewood Ranch resident, told me today. “And this is really important because currently the least invasive form of biopsy is actually the least conclusive, so a lot of doctors can’t use them.”</p>

      <title>More on Harrods' Gender-Neutral Toy Department</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/more-on-harrods-gender-neutral-toy-department</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some added context for <a href="http://danielsaurus.com/2012/8/harrods-gender-neutral-toy-department-now-open">the popular retailer's new gender-neutral toy department</a>. Consensus among smart people seems to be that the change is only a small step, but at least one in the right direction. (For reference, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/opinion/does-stripping-gender-from-toys-really-make-sense.html">here's an op-ed on "gender-free toys"</a> that Peggy Oreinstein penned last December, 2011.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why Explore Space</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/why-explore-space</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ernst Stuhlinger, then Associate Director for Science at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, writing in 1970 about why we should spend public expenditure on space exploration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much human suffering can be avoided if nations, instead of competing with their bomb-dropping fleets of airplanes and rockets, compete with their moon-travelling space ships! This competition is full of promise for brilliant victories, but it leaves no room for the bitter fate of the vanquished, which breeds nothing but revenge and new wars.</p>
  
  <p>Although our space program seems to lead us away from our Earth and out toward the moon, the sun, the planets, and the stars, I believe that none of these celestial objects will find as much attention and study by space scientists as our Earth. It will become a better Earth, not only because of all the new technological and scientific knowledge which we will apply to the betterment of life, but also because we are developing a far deeper appreciation of our Earth, of life, and of man.</p>

      <title>Outsourcing Education</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/outsourcing-education</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephanie Simon, writing for Reuters, offers a chilling look at the massive expansion of the involvement of private firms in public education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal: an education revolution in which public schools outsource to private vendors such critical tasks as teaching math, educating disabled students, even writing report cards, said Michael Moe, the founder of GSV.</p>
  
  <p>In the venture capital world, transactions in the K-12 education sector soared to a record $389 million last year, up from $13 million in 2005. That includes major investments from some of the most respected venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, according to GSV Advisors, an investment firm in Chicago that specializes in education.</p>
  
  <p>"It's time," Moe said. "Everybody's excited about it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>He said, as he profited off our children's education and our own naïveté.</em> What's really going on here? Education historian and professor Dianne Ravitch nails it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"They're taking education, which ought to be in a different sphere where we're constantly concerned about raising quality, and they're applying a business metric: How do we cut costs?" Ravitch said. [...] "This is a new frontier," Ravitch said. "The private equity guys and the hedge fund guys are circling public education."</p>
  
  <p>Some of the products and services offered by private vendors may well be good for kids and schools, Ravitch said. But she has no confidence in their overall quality because "the bottom line is that they're seeking profit first."</p>

      <title>You Can't Solve the 'Fatherhood Crisis' Without Getting Serious About Paternal Leave Policy</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/you-cant-solve-the-fatherhood-crisis-without-getting-serious-about-paternal-leave-policy</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An excellent piece in the Wall Street Journal about Sweden's longstanding – and compulsory – paid paternal leave policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since being instituted in 1974, the paternity-leave policy has evolved from being a mechanism to encourage women to join what was a depleted workforce in the 1970s, to serve as a tool for gender equality and home stability today.</p>
  
  <p>The Swedish government will pay 80% of a parent's salary—up to a cap of about $65,000—for 13 months. One parent can sign over all but two of these months to the other.</p>
  
  <p>Government statistics show the vast majority of fathers take off at least the minimum two months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within Sweden, the policies now garner near universal support – in fact, many Swedish politicians are now arguing that men should be required to take off a third month of leave after the birth of a child. </p>

<p>There's also another impact of the policy, though: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/world/europe/10iht-sweden.html">much as the New York Times reported in 2010</a>, gender roles and expectations have changed as a result of such structural policy changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The fathers of today are not cavemen with clubs in their hand, but men that take an ever increasing responsibility for home and family," wrote leading party member Lisbet Enbjerde in a November editorial in the Helsingborgs Dagblad newspaper.</p>
  
  <p>Tina Acketoft, a Folkpartiet member of parliament, says "it would have been unthinkable" to see a Swedish man taking care of children in the 1950s. "The fact that it is (now) legislated makes it socially acceptable."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It might be fair to argue there's a "fatherhood crisis" in America today. But you're not going to solve it simply by commenting on it; you have to put your money where your mouth is if you want to see real change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Case for Vacation</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/the-case-for-vacation</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Derek Thompson in The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as small breaks improve concentration, long breaks replenish job performance. Vacation deprivation increases mistakes and resentment at co-workers, Businessweek reported in 2007. "The impact that taking a vacation has on one's mental health is profound," said Francine Lederer, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles specializing told ABC News. "Most people have better life perspective and are more motivated to achieve their goals after a vacation, even if it is a 24-hour time-out."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why doesn't the same thinking apply to kids?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Adopting a Longer School Year to 'Improve Learning'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/adopting-a-longer-school-year-to-improve-learning</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today's segment of 'Trying to Solve the Wrong Problem in the Wrong Way, for the Wrong Reasons':&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>A typical public school calendar is 180 days, but the Balsz district, where 90 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch, is in session for 200 days, adding about a month to the academic year. [...]&nbsp;A growing group of education advocates is agitating for more time in schools, arguing that low-income children in particular need more time to catch up as schools face increasing pressure to improve student test scores.<br></p><p>“It’s not as simple as ‘Oh, if we just went 12 hours every kid would be Einstein,’&nbsp;” said Chris Gabrieli, chairman of the Boston group. “On the other hand, the more time you spend practicing or preparing to do something, the better you get at it.”&nbsp;</p><p></p></blockquote><p>Seems like a good idea... so long as you have absolutely no clue what the process of learning is actually like or what education is for. And hey, sure, yes, it could deliver you 'results'. But I've taken up <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/41">Merlin Mann's mantra:</a>&nbsp;<em>"There are no right answers if you're asking the wrong questions."</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Raising Successful Children</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/raising-successful-children</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noted psychologist Madeline Levine, author of the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Price-Privilege-Generation-Disconnected/dp/006059585X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=danielsaurusrex-20">The Price of Privilege</a></em> (as wll as a new one called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Your-Children-Well-Parenting/dp/0061824747/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_1_dp?tag=danielsaurusrex-20">Teach Your Children Well</a></em>), in a timely, must-read editorial for the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The happiest, most successful children have parents who do not do for them what they are capable of doing, or almost capable of doing; and their parents do not do things for them that satisfy their own needs rather than the needs of the child.</p>
  
  <p>The central task of growing up is to develop a sense of self that is autonomous, confident and generally in accord with reality.</p>

      <title>'On Kids and How to Help Them Grow'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/ben-delaney-on-kids-and-how-to-help-them-grow</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ben Delaney reminisces on parenting his children:</p><blockquote><span>I’ve adopted a new parenting philosophy over the last couple years, and a big part of it boils down to this: treat kids like they are capable of being strong, making decisions, and being generally “alive in the world”. Doing so instills more confidence and self-respect than protecting them from imaginary danger and shielding them from risk ever could. My kids are 9 and 5. We go to the woods as often as we can (at least once a week this time of year). We run and climb and play. I very purposefully do not tell them where to go or what to do. I don’t call them back when they start to wander. We just play and do. Having done this dozens of times now, I know the secret: they want to stay close to me. Sometimes they want to lead the way, and they do; other times I lead because they know that I know the way better. Minor cuts and bruises are rubbed off, spit on, and acknowledged for what they are, nothing more. Trees and rocks are for climbing and we climb them. Rope swings are for swinging, and rivers are for swimming.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span>The more I expose them to these environments (that most parents would consider “dangerous”), the more they respect them. They almost always self-regulate — if something is too big to try, they tend to not try it. If something is new, they come find me and ask for help, and we figure it out slowly, together. When we scramble along on the edge of the high cliffs, they don’t act squirly. We’ve already crawled up to the edge together and peered down into that void. I don’t have to tell them, they know it’s dangerous. They have a built-in respect for where they are and they play within the natural boundaries that they feel safe within. They almost never need to be told “be careful.” Honestly, it’s kind of amazing.<br></span></blockquote><p><span>Do read the full thing – and read the piece Ben links to about Swiss forest kindergartens; they both get to the heart of just so many good things about living life peacefully with children. The purpose of parenting has never been to protect your kids or shield them from the larger world. Instead, it's simply been to provide them with a safe place to explore from and then come back to at the end of the night, after their adventures – a place where they can find dinner still waiting for them, hot as ever.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Children Banned from Playing in the Street</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/housing-estate-bans-children-from-playing-in-the-street</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A story from Plymouth, UK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Residents living in Seven Trees Court received a letter from Westcountry Housing on Wednesday informing them that children are not to play on the estate. </p>
  
  <p>But Westcountry Housing said that it was "unfair" to call it a ban and claimed it was more about "parent responsibility".</p>
  
  <p>The letter said: "I am receiving complaints concerning children playing football, riding bikes/scooters, and skateboards on the Greenbank Estate which is causing a nuisance to residents. Please can you ensure that your children do not play football, ride bikes/scooters or skateboard in the parking areas or in the pedestrian areas around Albertha Close/Seven Trees Court. They should be using the grass area to play on."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sigh. <em>Shakes head.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>When Autistic Children Go Missing</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/when-autistic-children-go-missing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dean King, for Outside Magazine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Robert Wood Jr. disappeared in a densely forested Virginia park, searchers faced the challenge of a lifetime. The eight-year-old boy was autistic and nonverbal, and from his perspective the largest manhunt in state history probably looked like something else: the ultimate game of hide-and-seek.</p>

      <title>A Critique of the Banking System</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems to me that 12-year-old Victoria Grant pretty much nails it:</p>

<p>She's put into words what takes most economists reams of paper to say. It's also nice that she's twelve and has been extended an attentive and serious audience; that's not something most kids get. I'm sure there's plenty of tokenism behind the acceptance of her critique by many adults – yet I think its her words and argument that should be paid attention to, and that win her the day on this one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Stephen King Wants To be Taxed More</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/5/stephen-king-wants-to-be-taxed-more</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The author, in a special piece for The Daily Beast entitled "Tax Me for F*&amp;ck's Sake":</p><blockquote>Mitt Romney has said, in effect, “I’m rich and I don’t apologize for it.” Nobody wants you to, Mitt. What some of us want—those who aren’t blinded by a lot of bullshit persiflage thrown up to mask the idea that rich folks want to keep their damn money—is for you to acknowledge that you couldn’t have made it in America without America. That you were fortunate enough to be born in a country where upward mobility is possible (a subject upon which Barack Obama can speak with the authority of experience), but where the channels making such upward mobility possible are being increasingly clogged. That it’s not fair to ask the middle class to assume a disproportionate amount of the tax burden. Not fair? It’s un-fucking-American is what it is.</blockquote><p>Man, I love it when Stephen King is angry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Who Should Decide?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/who-should-decide</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of an ongoing dialogue at TED.com about education, some commentators  asked what I see as <em>the</em> rather salient question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thomas Brucia raised a question I would like to spend some more time on. He said, "Shouldn't the question be: 'Who should decide what the purpose of education is?'"</p>
  
  <p>In an age where control of is this answer and ultimately the fate of millions of children in the U.S. alone is held by corporations and the ultra-wealthy, I believe this is a righteous question and lever to examine. </p>
  
  <p>So, predicated on the understanding that whatever is deemed to be the purpose of education defines 12+ years of children's daily activities and habits in the form of formalized learning, aka schooling, who should decide what the purpose of education is? Is it corporations? Academics? Policy-makers? Teachers? Parents? <em>Students themselves?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's easy to get lost in discussions about the purpose of education. It's hard to take a step back and realize those conversations aren't necessarily ours to have.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Alfie Kohn: How Children’s ‘Play’ is Being Sneakily Redefined</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/11/alfie-kohn-how-childrens-play-is-being-sneakily-redefined</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kohn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don't know whether to laugh or shudder when you read a sentence like this one in a national magazine: "Kids need careful adult guidance and instruction before they are able to play in a productive way." But even staunch defenders of play -- and those who worry that children don't get enough opportunities to engage in it these days -- sometimes yield to the temptation of trying to justify play in terms of its usefulness.</p>
  
  <p>The problem is that to insist on its benefits risks violating the spirit, if not the very meaning, of play. In his classic work on the subject, Homo Ludens, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga described play as “a free activity standing quite consciously outside ordinary life as being ‘not serious’ but at the same absorbing the player intensely and utterly.” One plays because it’s fun to do so, not because of any instrumental advantage it may yield. The point isn’t to perform well or to master a skill, even though those things might end up happening. In G. K. Chesterton’s delightfully subversive aphorism, “If a thing is worth doing at all, it’s worth doing badly.”</p>

      <title>'How to Bore the Children'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/4/how-to-bore-the-children</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charles Eisenstein gives directions on how to bore children:</p><blockquote><p>Here is how to make a child bored: first and foremost, keep him indoors so that the infinitude of nature, its endless variation and chaotic messiness is replaced by a finite, orderly, predictable realm. Second, through television and video games, habituate him to intense stimuli so that everything else seems boring by comparison. Third, eliminate as much as possible any unstructured time with other children, so that he loses his capacity for creative play and needs entertainment instead. Fourth, shorten his attention span with fast-paced programming, dumbed-down books, and frequent interruptions of his play. Fifth, hover over him whenever possible to stunt his self-trust and make him dependent on outside stimulation. Sixth, hurry him from activity to activity to create anxiety about time and eliminate the easy sense of timelessness native to the young.</p></blockquote><p>The piece is somewhat needlessly prejudiced against media, but it still makes for nice musing. Plus, it introduces a new phrase I think I really like: “the primal self-sufficiency of play.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Dangers of “Oh, Grow Up”</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/9/2/oh-grow-up</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Boehner and Barack Obama engage in a very public battle over the timing of a speech, each side aiming thinly-veiled vitriol at the other, and the New York Times editorial board (rightly) decries it as political spectacle. But under what headline does the newspaper title and run the piece?</p>

<p><em>“Oh, grow up.”</em></p>

<p>The subtle, probably unintentional implication here is that Boehner and Obama are acting petulently, and only children act that way. It's a slippery, almost elusive slight – but absolutely powerful. You can't help but discriminate against children when you suggest ill-mannered behavior isn’t “grown up.” </p>

<p>We need to remember, though, that age and maturity aren't necessarily correlated things. A good many young children can display incredibly maturity, while many old men can be petty and arrogant, much as John Boehner here.</p>

<p>So, to the New York Times: instead of labeling this behavior as “childish” – or ascribing it to those who need to “grow up” or “act their age” – let’s stop demeaning kids and label this behavior what it really is: just plain immaturity. It’s as simple as that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fixing Math Education in America</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/8/fixing-math-education-in-america</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two mathematicians, Sol Garfunkle and David Mumford, respond to the concern that America is faring poorly in our math education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All this worry, however, is based on the assumption that there is a single established body of mathematical skills that everyone needs to know to be prepared for 21st-century careers. This assumption is wrong. The truth is that different sets of math skills are useful for different careers, and our math education should be changed to reflect this fact.</p>
  
  <p>Today, American high schools offer a sequence of algebra, geometry, more algebra, pre-calculus and calculus (or a “reform” version in which these topics are interwoven). This has been codified by the Common Core State Standards, recently adopted by more than 40 states. This highly abstract curriculum is simply not the best way to prepare a vast majority of high school students for life. (…)</p>
  
  <p>In math, what we need is “quantitative literacy,” the ability to make quantitative connections whenever life requires (as when we are confronted with conflicting medical test results but need to decide whether to undergo a further procedure) and “mathematical modeling,” the ability to move practically between everyday problems and mathematical formulations (as when we decide whether it is better to buy or lease a new car).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Garfunkle and Mumford (and really, they couldn’t be better named for two mathematicians) make an excellent argument against traditionalism in education, and the picture they later paint – of a holistically minded, culturally relevant math curriculum – just warms my heart. This is what school should be like.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <span>&#147;</span>When we engage in restoring childhood to some place in our thinking and recognize that childhood has significance in the development of the adult, it’s all right to talk generally about ‘childhood’ and ‘the child.’ But as a theoretical concept, ‘the Child’ is a fiction. We do not know enough about what children, as biologically given creatures, will do at different stages in development or under different cultural circumstances. […] We will not develop a useful theory of child development until we recognize that ‘the Child’ doesn’t exist.

      <title>Moving Beyond the Classroom</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/4/moving-beyond-the-classroom</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A great piece by Prakash Nair, responding in the magazine Education Week to the never-ending call for “education reform”:</p><blockquote><p>Lost in all this hand-wringing is the most visible symbol of a failed system: the classroom. Almost without exception, the reform efforts under way will preserve the classroom as our children’s primary place of learning deep into the 21st century. This is profoundly disturbing because staying with classroom-based schools could permanently sink our chances of rebuilding our economy and restoring our shrinking middle class to its glory days.</p><p>The classroom is a relic, left over from the Industrial Revolution.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, this is perhaps&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;most fundamental flaw of all education reform efforts in the past several decades, while at the same measure the most stubbornly – even vehemently – ignored. Go back and watch&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_%22Superman%22">Waiting for Superman</a></em>, for instance – the documentary widely heralded “to save public education.” You won’t find even a passing consideration in it of the most fundamental elemental of education: individual students and learners. Nor will you find any challenge to the past industrial-era mindset of education as a passive “conveyor belt”-like consumption of knowledge – in fact the documentary almost criminally perpetuates this destructive model, while ignoring a vast decades-old body of scientific research that proves that learning doesn’t happen this way.</p><p>Instead of considering this most basic element of education,&nbsp;<em>Waiting for Superman</em>&nbsp;– like so many education reform debates and efforts before it, and I’m sure many more to come – settles for skirting the issue and blowing around more hot air. It seems almost dogmatically fixated on the relatively superficial things in public education, like teachers’ unions and rubber rooms, student tracking and charter schools – incorrectly labeling these things as the root problems of (or, in some cases, solutions to) our system, without even stopping to consider whether it could be something more fundamental.</p><p>That’s the problem in the “education reform” world: We’re not lacking for magic answers, for solutions that we’re sure will “fix the system”. The thing is they’re useless, though, and will continue to be, so long as we avoid asking the right questions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bill Watterson on Children and Parents</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/4/zsngyf10pch7gxvymz5zghxg62x1xw</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Calvin and Hobbes” creator Bill Watterson, in a rare Q&amp;A exchange that took place in 2005:</p><blockquote><p>Q: What attributes do you wish were seen more commonly among children?</p><p>A: Good parents!</p></blockquote><p>Typical for Bill Watterson: a simple, direct, even mousy response – but unexpectedly truthful. I was caught off guard by it at first, actually, thinking about how most people would likely reel off &nbsp;a long answer to the question. Of course Watterson would see it from the kids’ side, though; leave it him to recognize that many of the problems children children – and the deficiencies we like to find in children – actually have their roots in the failings and indifference of the adults around them instead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mary Poppins’ Job Performance</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/mary-poppins-job-performance</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How would Mary Poppins measure up in a formal job evaluation? McSweeney’s has the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While her communication skills are questionable, her judgment is completely unsound. In the past, she has neglected errands assigned to her, including hiring a piano tuner, purchasing gingerbread and shopping for fish, in favor of taking the children to visit one of her mentally incapacitated relatives, commonly referred to as “Uncle Albert.” This frivolous outing ended with my children being stricken with a similar illness, whose side effects include drinking tea on the ceiling. Similarly dangerous daytrips include horse racing and gallivanting on rooftops with dance crews of like-minded chimney sweeps. Worst of all, May Poppins deceived me into bringing my children into work at the bank with me.</p>

      <link>/blog/2011/8/13/there-will-be-riots</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The signs were already there. 18-year-old Chavez Campbell from north&nbsp;<span class="olwimpics_block">London</span>, for instance, saw them:</p><blockquote><p>A week before it began, Campbell, in an interview with the Guardian about cuts to youth services, predicted what would happen. Asked what he thought the future held, he said, simply: “There’ll&nbsp;be riots.”</p><p>Looking at his words again, he said: “I&nbsp;did see the riots coming and the government should have seen it coming, too. Jobs are hard to get and, when they do become available, youths don’t get the jobs. There is nothing to do, they are closing youth clubs so the streets are just crazy. They are full of people who have no ambitions, or have ambitions but can’t fulfil them.”</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Of Riots and Revolutions</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/4/of-riots-and-revolutions</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the riots that have broken out across England&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots">continuing for a fourth night in a row</a>, Andrew Sullivan has culled together highlights from how the United Kingdom’s major press outlets are responding to them. It’s interesting to see the wide range of ways we as human beings process and characterize events like these, as well as the motivations of those behind them. Consider, for example, the difference in these two characterizations:</p><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2024284/UK-riots-2011-Liberal-dogma-spawned-generation-brutalised-youths.html">The Daily Mail</a>:</p><blockquote><p>They are essentially wild beasts. I use that phrase advisedly, because it seems appropriate to young people bereft of the discipline that might make them employable; of the conscience that distinguishes between right and wrong. They respond only to instinctive animal impulses — to eat and drink, have sex, seize or destroy the accessible property of others. Their behaviour on the streets resembled that of the polar bear which attacked a Norwegian tourist camp last week. They were doing what came naturally and, unlike the bear, no one even shot them for it.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0_NQAij_BxoJ:www.morningstaronline.co.uk/news/content/view/full/108077+http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/news/content/view/full/108077&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari&amp;source=www.google.com">Morning Star</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It is meaningless complaining that many teenagers show no respect without appreciating the reality that they too are often treated without respect.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>But Think of the Children!</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/4/bzsn81vw11i9oifmgj3vpxvjnt4dw7</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, speaking to a crowd in Iowa about preschool programs like Head Start:</p><blockquote><p>“Of course, the government wants their hands on your children as fast as they can. That is why I opposed all these early starts and pre-early starts, and early-early starts. They want your children from the womb so they can indoctrinate your children as to what they want them to be. I am against that.”</p></blockquote><p>It isn’t the first time he’s said so, either; last May, Santorum somewhat inexplicably compared preschool education to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/08/primary-elections-2012_n_859037.html">his grandfather’s experiences in Fascist-era Italy</a>. Now&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;strikes me as a step particularly beyond&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_interests">using “children’s interests” as a strawman argument</a>&nbsp;and officially into verified paranoia territory.</p><p>To put it another way: in the world of the Simpsons, Santorum would be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh2sWSVRrmo">Helen Lovejoy</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Lessons from Playwork</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/lessons-from-playwork</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wonderful friend&nbsp;<a href="http://playeverything.wordpress.com/">Morgan Leichter-Saxby</a>&nbsp;recently wrote what I feel is a brilliant summation of the spirit that drives&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playwork">Playwork</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://adventureplaygrounds.hampshire.edu/">adventure playgrounds</a>&nbsp;in the UK. Framed as five basic lessons she learned from her experiences as a playworker, they appear simple enough, at least at first glance – but having spent countless afternoons in adventure playgrounds myself, I can tell you there is a treasure trove of truth here.</p><p>Please do go off and read her full post, pip pip, but for now here are Morgan’s five lessons – they’re honestly all you really need, I believe, to help guide you to having rich and wonderful relationships with children:</p><blockquote><ol><li><strong>Notice everything.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciate how the world around you looks, feels and smells. &nbsp;Think about what else you could do with the things that surround you, what else they could become.</li><li><strong>Be brave, in your own time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Different things are hard for different people. &nbsp;It’s okay – you can decide what’s right for you when you’re ready.</li><li><strong>Be good to people.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;They’ll generally be good back, and when you meet some who aren’t you’re more likely to have friends to help you out!</li><li><strong>Be yourself.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything’s more fun if you stop worrying about whether you look silly or might get it wrong. &nbsp;It’s too tiring to try and be what you think other people expect, and frankly not worth the effort.</li><li><strong>Be flexible.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay light on your feet and keep your eyes open. &nbsp;Unexpected and wonderful things happen all the time, and you don’t want to miss a moment.</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>'How to Talk to Little Girls'</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/8/how-to-talk-to-little-girls</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it seems ridiculous that you'd need even instructions for this. But, as Lisa Bloom explores, our speech when interacting with young children can have a profound effect on gender roles and what we expect from children. In short: the <em>"Ahhh, look at the cute little girl!" </em>icebreaker talk just ain't gonna cut it. Bloom&nbsp;suggests something different:</p><blockquote><p>Try this the next time you meet a little girl. She may be surprised and unsure at first, because few ask her about her mind, but be patient and stick with it. Ask her what she’s reading. What does she like and dislike, and why? There are no wrong answers. You’re just generating an intelligent conversation that respects her brain. For older girls, ask her about current events issues: pollution, wars, school budgets slashed. What bothers her out there in the world? How would she fix it if she had a magic wand? You may get some intriguing answers. Tell her about your ideas and accomplishments and your favorite books. Model for her what a thinking woman says and does.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Struck Out, Before Getting to the Plate</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/struck-out-before-getting-to-the-plate</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Africa’s first Little League baseball team to reach the Little League World Series – the Rev. John Foundation Little League team from Kampala, Uganda – has just found out that, sadly, they won’t be able to travel to the annual Williamsport, Pa., event at all. Their forced absence is the result of a lack of full documentation for the children, and complications with the United States’ visa and immigration policies.</p><p>A disappointment all around, but especially for the kids:</p><blockquote>“It’s a shame,” [documentary filmmaker] Shapiro said. “Their country isn’t ready for this. The schools aren’t ready. The parents aren’t ready. The only thing that’s ready are the kids and their talent. They will make it one day, and if there is anything positive out of this, it’s for people to realize what wonderful things are happening with these kids. They’ve got their own little world growing here.”</blockquote><p class="p1"><i></i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/sports/for-uganda-little-leaguers-exhilaration-and-then-heartbreak.html?src=recg&amp;pagewanted=all"><i>You can&nbsp;</i>read more from the kids themselves here,</a> along with a bit about the history of the fledgling roots of Little League baseball in Africa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2012/8/hes-not-my-character-to-write-anymore</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dad writes (or tries to write) about his son on the eve of his 13th birthday. A beautiful piece. (Via&nbsp;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/28/not-my-character">John Gruber</a>&nbsp;– who is, indeed, correct: this is the nicest thing you’ll read today.)</p><blockquote><p>So turning 13 and beyond was both terrible and wonderful but the fact remains that all these ideas recoiled when I tried to address them in relation to my son’s 13th birthday. And it’s only here, in this 7th paragraph (again, fuck you writer’s block), where my block begins to find its logic. It is precisely this unsaying that defines my son’s movement into teen life. This inability to speak about him, his resistance to being said, the fact of his emerging own life apart from our relation creates the substance of the block.</p><p>He’s stepping into the light of being the main character in a story that evades the reach of my narrative. He’s not my character to write anymore.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Al Franken, Nuclear Families, and the Needs of Children</title>
      <link>/blog/writing/al-franken-nuclear-families-and-the-needs-of-children</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several days ago, in a hearing about the U.S. Defense of Marriage Act, Senator Al Franken disputed the testimony of a witness from the fundamentalist Christian organization&nbsp;<a href="http://www.family.org/">Focus on the Family</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/07/20/274032/franken-destoys-focus-on-the-family-witness-exposes-misuse-of-hhs-study/">ThinkProgress</a>&nbsp;shares more about the encounter:<br></p><blockquote><p>During this morning’s Senate DOMA hearings, Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) destroyed Focus on the Family’s Tom Minnery’s argument that children are better off with opposite-sex parents by demonstrating how Minnery misrepresented an HHS study. The study — which Minnery cited to oppose marriage equality — actually found that children do best in two-parent households, regardless of the parents’ gender.</p></blockquote><p>Here's video of Franken:</p>
 
   <iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZyAueltLsa4?fs=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
 
<p class="youtube5use-original youtube5show-on-waiting">Normally I’d avoid linking to something so potentially partisan, but this incident – which has been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59495.html">well-popularized</a>&nbsp;around the Internet since it happened – seems to be a prime opportunity to take a look at a very complicated issue: that of what families should look like, what children’s needs are, and what parenting really is all about.</p><p>First, it almost goes without saying that this is a fine example of how research findings can easily be abused and misused. But second, and arguably more interestingly, this incident also highlights how swiftly ‘parenting’ can be co-opted by cultural beliefs and dogma – and, getting to the heart of the matter, how far our society’s concepts and public discussions of ‘parenting’ and ‘families’ have been removed from where I believe they should really lie: with children themselves. Ideally, I believe we should view ‘Parenting’ as as a responsibility taken on by an adult, whether through the birth or adoption of a child,&nbsp;<em>to meet and provide for that child’s needs</em>; while ‘Families’ can be viewed simply as&nbsp;<em>whoever comes together around children to help in that task of meeting their needs</em>. Unfortunately, such a focus on children themselves and their needs is often far from the true center of public discussions about families – so if I may, I’d like to try to reframe things here, in these different terms.</p><h3>Reconsidering Families and Parenting through the Lens of Children’s Needs</h3><p>Parenting can be seen through several different frames of reference. First there is a societal perspective – where parenting can be seen as a way to either perpetuate current social traditions and ways of life, or to prepare ‘future members of society’ for continued adaptation and the ability to meet the challenges of the future. Parenting can also be seen from a parent’s perspective – where the act of parenting provides some sort of meaning, gratification or change in the life of the parent. Finally, we can view parenting from the child’s perspective – where a parent is typically the primary person in their lives through whom that child’s needs are met.</p><p>It’s likely fair to say that all these frames of reference are valid, and can potentially be complementary to each other. Yet often, Western cultures like ours get&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;wrapped up in the first two perspectives, at the neglect or even exploitation of the third.</p><p>Yes, parenting is largely a cultural and philosophical act: how you interact with your children, and the environments and experiences you establish for them, is I think a profound statement on the way you see the world and how you want it to be. And Mr. Minnery and the Focus on the Family organization have every right to work toward a family subculture of their own, that matches their vision of the world. But, first, it is a problem when you try to press this subculture on others; second, and more disturbing, it is malicious and exploitative to intentionally misuse the researched evidence around children’s lives – to in essence use children themselves – to justify your own way of life, while persecuting others for theirs.</p><p>In this particular case, the research around children and their well-being proves that children are undeniably resilient and accommodating of many different family structures – and contrary to Mr. Minnery’s fervent belief, can absolutely still thrive while having two parents of the same sex, so long as their needs are still being met.</p><h3>The Real Needs of Children</h3><p>Since we raise the topic of children’s needs – and since we bandy about the term so freely in our discussions, often using it to justify our own prejudices and beliefs – it stands to question: what are these actual needs of children? Interestingly, they appear to be fewer and far more basic than one might imagine, according to eminent psychologist&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Kagan">Jerome Kagan</a>. After conducting decades of longitudinal studies globally, Kagan established that children, across all cultures, have only four essential, universal needs that have to be met in order for them to grow up emotionally and physically strong and socially well-adapted. They are:</p><ol><li>Environmental variability;</li><li>Predictability;</li><li>Caretaking by adult(s) (as opposed to other children);</li><li>Opportunity to practice their motor skills.<a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/P15/#fn:1">1</a></li></ol><p>Both&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0582784530/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=danielsauru07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0582784530">history</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521664756/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=danielsauru07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0521664756">cultural anthropology</a>&nbsp;bear out that children can and have had these needs met in an infinitely rich and diverse number of ways. And everything else surrounding children and childrearing, everything outside of these needs, is either ultimately unnecessary or some culturally defined variant of these needs.</p><p>What the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_10/sr10_246.pdf">study by the Health and Human Services department</a>&nbsp;(link goes to full PDF of the study), which Minnery unsuccessfully tried to use, clearly shows – and any number of other recent studies can corroborate – is that children need to grow up in a predictable family structure, where they are reassured that their needs will be met… but how and by whom those needs are met simply just doesn’t matter that much, provided that predictability is there.</p><p>To quote&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-01/w-dcn012110.php">another important study</a>&nbsp;which examined the significance of gender in parenting:&nbsp;<em>“The family type that is best for children is one that has responsible, committed, stable parenting… The gender of parents only matters in ways that don’t matter.”</em></p><h3>What about Single Parent Families?</h3><p>An inevitable question soon arises about whether two-parent (or ‘nuclear’) households are better for children than single-parent households, and can offer more stability, commitment, and so on. To continue to quote&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-01/w-dcn012110.php">the same study</a>&nbsp;from earlier, though:&nbsp;<em>“One really good parent is better than two not-so-good ones.”</em>&nbsp;Predictability also comes in an emotional form, and one committed parent can provide this relationally to children just as well as two might.</p><p>One area where single parents do have the deck stacked against them, though, is the simple matter of practicalities. With single parents raising children on their own, you can statistically expect for their household’s family income (in a North American context) to be half, or often less than half, that of a typical two-parent (usually dual-earning) household’s family income. You can also generally expect for a single parent to have far fewer available hours in the week to devote to childcare and to attending to children’s needs, compared to two parents in a household who together can have more hours to devote to the children. So the question isn’t whether single parents are inherently worse parents, or whether children inherently&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;two parents, but whether a single parent has as equal an ability as a two-parent household practically and financially to meet the children’s needs. This is not to say that single parents can’t make it all work out, just that statistically it is simply harder for them, at least without an established social network of help.</p><p>But I don’t see this as an argument against single-parent family arrangements – or any type of other family arrangement. I simply see this as a sign that we as a society should increase the support we offer to&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;parents and families – politically, with better family leave policies, universal healthcare, and more accommodating employers and work schedules; and culturally, with supportive neighborhoods and community programs, a positive and caring collective attitude toward children, and a better understanding and openness in our culture of the struggles parents face every day.</p><p>Nuclear families, mothers and fathers, homosexual parents… It’s too easy to fall into the trap of blindly upholding and believing in particular family and social structures around children. What we need to realize are that these structures are cultural and, ultimately, don’t matter as much as we think they do. Meanwhile, the one thing that is truly important – making sure children’s needs are met – can be realized in any number of infinitely rich and diverse ways.</p><p>For kids, at least, there is no one right way to have a ‘family’.</p><p class="footnotes"></p><ol><li><p>Kagan, J.

      <title>A Profile of Maurice Sendak</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/7/a-profile-of-maurice-sendak</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written by Dave Eggers and photographed by Annie Leibovitz, Vanity Fair has a new,‘can’t miss’&nbsp;portrait of the famed children's author:</p><blockquote><p>Maurice Sendak’s sense of humor is pitch-black and ribald, though this fact, and the baroque essence of his work, is often lost on readers now that his books have become canonical. “A woman came up to me the other day and said, ‘You’re the kiddie-book man!’ I wanted to kill her.” He hates to be thought of as safe or his work as classic, and he won’t tolerate overpraise. “My work is not great, but it’s respectable. I have no false illusions.”</p><p>He’s wrong, of course. Sendak is the best-known, and by most measures simply the best, living creator of picture books, and in the stretch of years since his most prolific period—when he made&nbsp;<em>In the Night Kitchen</em>,&nbsp;<em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>,&nbsp;<em>Kenny’s Window</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Sign on Rosie’s Door</em>, and the “Nutshell Library”—his work has only grown in stature. No one has been more uncompromising, more idiosyncratic, and more in touch with the unhinged and chiaroscuro subconscious of a child.</p></blockquote><p>Sendak’s upcoming picture book,&nbsp;<em>Bumble-Ardy</em>&nbsp;– the first he’s done solely on his own since 1981’s&nbsp;<em>Outside Over There</em>&nbsp;– looks great, and I can’t wait for it. Anymore, though, I find myself more excited by Maurice Sendak himself. He’s a fascinating man, both as an artist and an individual, and he holds what I think is a wonderful attitude and philosophy about children and childhood. If you ever wanted a glimpse into his life and thoughts, I can’t recommend enough that you go out and watch the 2010 documentary&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033XKVE6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thiisdan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0033XKVE6">Tell Them Anything You Want</a></em>, by Spike Jonze and Lance Bangs: it’s an uncompromisingly honest portrait of him, one that touches on the many wonderfully rich, philosophical themes that have emerged throughout his life.</p><p>Though he is now 83 years old, it strikes me that, just in these past few years, ol’ Maurice has perhaps become more alive and honest and connected to life than ever before.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Children's Playhouses, Grown-Up Cash</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/childrens-playhouses-grown-up-cash</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A New York Times feature looks at the booming ‘playhouse’ construction business that’s taken off, despite the recession:</p><blockquote>Mr. Dwyer has installed playhouses that look like pirate ships, windmills and castles at the homes of several film and <span class="s1">sports</span> stars who asked not to be named to protect their children’s privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>“Only a certain kind of clientele can afford what we offer,” he said. And few have backyards big enough to hold it. Red Beard’s Revenge, for example, is a $52,000 playhouse in the shape of a 12-foot-tall, 18-foot-long pirate ship, complete with a crow’s nest, upper and lower decks made of mahogany and leather benches in the captain’s quarters that double as beds. […]</blockquote><blockquote>Barbara Butler, an artist and playhouse builder in San Francisco, said her sales are up 40 percent this year, and she has twice as many future commissions lined up as she did this time last year. Not only that, but the average price of the structures she is being hired to build has more than doubled, from $26,000 to $54,000.</blockquote><p class="p1">It’s probably easy to see the ludicrousness in all of this – but let’s take a stab at it, shall we? Real imaginative play is almost directly antithetical to predesigned, adult-built structures, which lack all of the opportunities for a child’s agency and control over the environment that, say, a plain stack of scavenged wood, a bucket of nails, and a little paint might offer that child. In fact, while the obligatorily-quoted psychologist in the article, Dr. Steven Tuber of City University of New York, notes that “over-the-top playhouses may do something for the parent’s sense of grandeur, [but] certainly are irrelevant to the child’s needs and desires for a play space,” I’d go further and say they’re not just irrelevant but are directly obstructive to children’s play – adulterating it with preconceived expectations about what that play should be, to say nothing of shifting the control and maintenance of the environment over to adults.</p><p class="p1">What strikes me as more ludicrous, though, are the dominant reasons people seem to be buying – and builders seem to capitalize on while selling – these expensive playhouses:</p><blockquote>“Childhood is a precious and finite thing,” Ms. Butler said. “And a special playhouse is not the sort of thing you can put off until the economy gets better.”</blockquote><p class="p1">Not to go on an Old Sociologist Guy rant here, but – well, yes, to go on a rant… Let’s just be clear on something. “Childhood” = not about how fancy of stuff you had growing up, while “being a good parent” = not about simply outspending your neighbors on fancy playhouses and Baby Einstein DVDs. And there’s nothing “precious” about childhood; that’s just you being stupidly drunk with nostalgia. To the point: while some of these playhouses might look cute, and even be fun for children (for a while), they ultimately only undercut children’s independence, creativity, and control over their play – whereas these kids might just be better served with a bike and a summer of free afternoons where they can do whatever they like, and scavenge for spare materials and loose parts to build their own playhouses.</p><p>If there’s one <span class="s2">silver</span> lining to all of this, it’s that I think kids see through all this BS quite clearly. The kids from the families featured in the article might be too young now, but it won’t be long before they’re 10 or 11 years old and taking a hammer and saw to the playhouse because they know that can build something that’s better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Can a Playground Be Too Safe?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/can-a-playground-be-too-safe</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Tierney, in the New York Times, reports on a new Norwegian research study about playground safety:</p><blockquote>Even if children do suffer fewer physical injuries — and the evidence for that is debatable — the critics say that these playgrounds may stunt emotional development, leaving children with anxieties and fears that are ultimately worse than a broken bone.</blockquote><blockquote>“Children need to encounter risks and overcome fears on the playground,” said Ellen Sandseter, a professor of psychology at Queen Maud University in Norway. “I think monkey bars and tall slides are great. As playgrounds become more and more boring, these are some of the few features that still can give children thrilling experiences with heights and high speed.”</blockquote><p class="p1">Continuing:</p><blockquote>By gradually exposing themselves to more and more dangers on the playground, children are using the same habituation techniques developed by therapists to help adults conquer phobias, according to Dr. Sandseter and a fellow psychologist, Leif Kennair, of the Norwegian University for Science and Technology.</blockquote><blockquote>“Risky play mirrors effective cognitive behavioral therapy of anxiety,” they write in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, concluding that this “anti-phobic effect” helps explain the evolution of children’s fondness for thrill-seeking. While a youthful zest for exploring heights might not seem adaptive — why would natural selection favor children who risk death before they have a chance to reproduce? — the dangers seemed to be outweighed by the benefits of conquering fear and developing a sense of mastery.</blockquote><blockquote>“Paradoxically,” the psychologists write, “we posit that our fear of children being harmed by mostly harmless injuries may result in more fearful children and increased levels of psychopathology.”</blockquote><p class="p1">Certainly, Sandseter and Kennair’s new study is just one more to go onto a heap of past studies – heralding from all disciplines and dating back over the past several decades – that reinforce children’s need for risk-taking, and that acknowledge the paradoxical dangers of a too-safe childhood environment. It’s still good to see the issue once again pushed to the fore, though.</p><p class="p1">What’s perhaps more interesting, to me at least, is to see how popular Tierney’s article actually is right now; despite only being published yesterday, it currently ranks #3 in the Most Emailed articles on the NYTimes.com’s website – and just speaking personally, I’ve been forwarded a link to it from no less than a dozen different people, from varying and in many cases unexpected backgrounds. (Even for me that rate and the diversity of sources is unusual.) Likewise, I’ve noticed that Lori Gottlieb’s essay in the Atlantic, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/how-to-land-your-kid-in-therapy/8555/"><span class="s1">“How to Land Your Kid in Therapy”</span></a>, has experienced a similar effect: it is <em>still</em> #2 in Most Popular articles there – despite being published nearly a month ago – and it has continued to maintain a similar ranking every time I check it every few days or so.</p><p class="p1">I’m not sure what this says about us adults, but it certainly appears that children’s lives and play are <em>the</em> vogue topics to discuss right now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h1 class="text-align-center">Mr. Shamada, Doctor Who, Yoda and the WanderMonster</h1><p>A couple of weeks ago I got to chat with Rob Kimmel – a Brooklyn-based dad who has, for a couple of years running now, joined with his son to &nbsp;create a sort of&nbsp;“daily sticky note drawing/story”&nbsp;&nbsp;together.</p><p>Rob probably&nbsp;<a href="http://wandermonster.com/about-the-lunch-posts/"><span class="s1">explains the whole thing best</span></a>:</p><blockquote>Every day of school, from kindergarten through second grade, I have sent my son off with a sticky note fixed to the inside lid of his lunchbox. Each of these little pieces of colored paper bears a half-completed drawing and a half-written story. I anxiously await picking him up after school to see how he finishes these miniature comics.</blockquote><p class="p2">Among the many comics Rob and Ben have co-authored, one can find the likes of&nbsp;<a href="http://wandermonster.com/2011/06/22/lunch-post-who-is-the-king-of-all-wild-things-now-that-max-is-gone/"><span class="s1">Mr. Shamada</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://wandermonster.com/2011/06/24/bens-birthday-art/"><span class="s1">Doctor Who</span></a>&nbsp;(who has, apparently, taken up&nbsp;<span class="s2">fencing</span>&nbsp;– actually, this one appears to be all Ben’s doing),&nbsp;<a href="http://wandermonster.com/2011/07/20/lunch-post-batman-seems-pissed/"><span class="s1">Batman</span></a>, a&nbsp;<a href="http://wandermonster.com/2011/07/18/lunch-post-the-yeti-disguised-as/"><span class="s1">Yeti disguised as Yoda</span></a>, and so many more. Needless to say, the whole thing’s a veritable treasure trove of awesome.</p><p class="p2">But what’s really intriguing, to me at least, is the basic idea: a father offering his kid a creative provocation, and his kid joining in and fulfilling it – both as artists on “equal” footing, more or less. It’s this last part which interests me, and which seems so challenging to conventional parenting ideologies. Think about it: when was the last time you saw a parent and a child working on something together, on&nbsp;<em>equal</em>&nbsp;terms and both fully engaged? When a child’s unique perspective was not only acknowledged, but eagerly embraced and transformed into a&nbsp;<em>key</em>&nbsp;defining part of the project? With a parent and a child both earnestly, mutually&nbsp;<em>enjoying</em>&nbsp;each other’s participation? Certainly, Rob and his son Ben’s relationship isn’t solely defined by their WanderMonster project, but I get the sense that it does illuminate a richer, more full realization of what a family can look like. I think above all, what I get from looking at their working together is a sense of how much a father and son can truly&nbsp;<em>enjoy each other</em>&nbsp;– and that’s just not something I think American parents are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/links/the-self-pitying-and-resentment-behind-go-the-fk-to-sleep/"><span class="s1">acculturated to expect</span></a>&nbsp;of their relationship with their child.</p><p class="p2">Since Rob and I talked, he's had a new article about the project published&nbsp;<span class="s1"><a href="http://www.howdesign.com/design-creativity/creative-exercises/designer-parents/">in HOW Design magazine</a>.</span>&nbsp;He explains the philosophy behind WanderMonster, as well as how many parents are increasingly partaking&nbsp;in “creative play” together with their kids:</p><blockquote>Play has always been part of my design process. Just as scientists are kids who never forgot how to explore and ask questions, I think artists are kids who never stopped playing or drawing. My best work has come not from sweaty grid-building and pixel-pushing, but from experimentation. […] It wasn’t much of a leap to apply that way of creative brainstorming to parenting. Having a child has been an opportunity to share some of my methods on another level, to train a collaborator.</blockquote><blockquote>This is a great time to be a parent. We aren’t so hung up on old-school conventions of adult behavior and traditional roles (especially for fathers, who get to participate in our kids’ lives to an extent rarely seen in previous generations). Imaginative play is getting the respect it deserves, with ideas like “multiple intelligences” unlocking the potential of kids who may have been bored or ignored in the past. After a couple of generations when people forgot how to make things, many are rediscovering tool benches and sewing machines. Meanwhile, the economy has forced us to buy fewer things off the shelf, driving the DIY ethic into the mainstream. All these factors combine to validate creative parenting. Making stuff together—whether with a camera or clay, a stove top or power drill—bonds us in a visceral way.</blockquote><p>Rob later shares a number of ideas for how parents create opportunities like this to bond with their children over mutually shared creative play activities. If you have a kid of your own, or work with them, you’ll want to give this a read: it’s terrific stuff. I’m excited to see how mainstream “creative parenting” is slowly becoming, and I’m intrigued even more by how the act of parents and children simply and freely “building and playing together” might ultimately help build a genuine appreciation and enjoyment of each other between them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>'Our Broken Escalator'</h1><p class="p1">One of my favorite columnists, Nick Kristof, recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/opinion/sunday/17kristof.html">shared some thoughts</a> on the slow decline of our American education system:</p><blockquote>My beloved old high school in Yamhill, Ore. — a plain brick building that was my rocket ship — is emblematic of that trend. There were only 167 school days in the last school year here (180 was typical until the recession hit), and the staff has been reduced by 9 percent over five years.</blockquote><blockquote>This school was where I embraced <span class="s1">sports</span>, became a journalist, encountered intellectual worlds, and got in trouble. These days, the 430 students still have opportunities to get into trouble, but the rest is harder.</blockquote><blockquote>For the next school year, freshman and junior varsity <span class="s2">sports</span> teams are at risk, and all students will have to pay $125 to participate on a team. The school newspaper, which once doubled as a biweekly newspaper for the entire town, has been terminated.</blockquote><blockquote>Business classes are gone. A music teacher has been eliminated. Class size is growing, with more than 40 students in freshman Spanish. “It’s like a long, slow bleed, watching things disappear,” says the school district’s business manager, Michelle Morrison.</blockquote><p class="p1">Coming from Kristof, who’s spent much of his career reporting on developing countries around the world, it’s truly poignant and disappointing to see how far we’ve strayed from the values that once made us strong as a country. Certainly, the nature of ‘education’ has changed – the needs of our society have moved on from the turn-of-the-twentieth-century industrial demands which once pushed the American education system forward. We no longer need (if we ever did) schools to function as factories, to educate and deploy a stable and homogenous workforce. The nature of schools and the function of education is – and should be – undergoing a more fundamental, if conflicted, paradigmal shift. </p><p class="p1">But this is different. What Kristof speaks of here is about how we simply, plainly no longer value education in general, regardless of form.</p><p class="p1">We treat teachers abysmally, pay them poorly, disparage their unions and blame them for the problems of a system which, at its root, is currently fundamentally flawed and problematic. We bind the hands of school principals and district administrators to bring about larger change, burying them with reports and regulations – done out of the call for “accountability”, a word for which we have neither a clear definition nor proper understanding – and we force schools into operating within whatever is the cheapest and most barebones model of education that will still deliver adequate results on fanciful, made-up tests which have little to do with real education. And the children themselves, those we uphold as “our future”, we’ve disregarded with a whiff of disdain – if we render them any attention at all. Schools have been shaped into concrete prisons, far removed from the centers of our community life; where once schools were integral places in our communities and neighborhoods, as Kristof for instance recalls about how his old school newspaper doubled as the town’s biweekly newspaper, their societal role now has been marginalized and relegated to simply “educating” (or more often just “protecting”, or worse, <em>“containing”</em>) “the children.” We’ve devalued children’s roles in society, no longer recognizing or welcoming what good they can bring as members to community life – and by extension, we’ve done the same to schools and education; we’ve turned the one last place left where children can interact with and contribute to the surrounding community into a static prison, lifeless and bound by burdensome worries and demands, a place where children’s own voices and contributions don’t matter.</p><p class="p1">Think about it: when was the last time you actually entered and spent a meaningful amount of time in a local school (one your own children didn’t attend)? How often today do you see a local school’s <span class="s3">sport</span> team treated like royalty, with the entire population showing to support them at games and players being known and congratulated outside of school? How often are you encouraged in your local community to actually know the children who live in your neighborhood, who aren’t yours or friends of yours? What level of expectations, if any, do you see your local community setting and holding of its schools – and of the children in those schools? What does your community ask of them, and in what ways are children really actually encouraged to contribute and participate? Have you ever read, or had a chance to read, an essay or opinion of a student in the community whom you didn’t know personally? When was the last time you saw a school or group of children really <em>valued</em> by the community, upheld as a prized part of its local community life, and supported with the necessary resources and attention?</p><p class="p1">We can ask if our schools and education system are in decline, but I think <em>these</em> are some of the more relevant and insightful questions for the moment. I think what matters now isn’t so much the quality of schools themselves, but their decreasing place and importance in our communities. What matters now is something far larger and more central to the whole of society.</p><p class="p1">I’ve strayed from Kristof’s column and his central point, but I will end with this: I think he’s right. We don’t value education and we don’t support our schools; if we did, our financial budgets and legislative priorities would look different. But I will go further and say that our schools crumble not only because they lack our financial support, and not only because we no longer value education – <em>but because we no longer value children themselves</em>.</p><p class="p1">We’ve become a society which has no place for children. We’ve slowly but steadily distanced them from our public life and discourse. We’ve removed them, psychologically and physically, from much of our society. And we stand by and let the schools we keep them in rot and fall away, with them inside.</p><p>That’s the larger tragedy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sex, Violence, and the Supreme Court</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/7/sex-violence-and-the-supreme-court</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Writing in an op-ed for the New York Times, Timothy Egan takes on a little sex and violence – with some mild dismemberment and naked boobs thrown in for good measure – as he considers one of the more peculiar double-standards held by American culture, one which only continued to be upheld by last month’s Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/tags/Brown+v+EMA"><span class="s1">Brown v. EMA</span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>Ultimately, the back-and-forth by the high court reinforced the notion of a nation that will always be a little skittish about sex, while viewing violence as American as apple pie. If this ruling is indeed a triumph for the First Amendment, it continues a strange double standard. […]</blockquote>
<blockquote>Settling the law of the land on this latest iteration of age-old question, the court’s decision makes it clear that children are free to slice a clothed Godiva to bits — on screen — but should be shielded from seeing her as she was when she rode through the streets of Coventry.</blockquote>
<p>I think Egan’s perspective falls apart a bit when he tries to poke holes in Scalia’s opinion on the effects of video game violence (the whole of the research clearly backs up Scalia on this, I believe), but Egan’s central premise is great: Why does America feel so uncomfortable with nudity, and yet not violence?</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On ‘The End of Zero Risk in Childhood’</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/on-the-end-of-zero-risk-in-childhood</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim Gill, writing in an op-ed in the Guardian:</p>








<blockquote>The time is right to move beyond unproductive debates about the “blame culture” and instead to build momentum behind the idea of expanding children’s horizons. What is needed is nothing less than the wholesale rejection of the philosophy of protection. In its place, what we need to adopt is a philosophy of resilience that truly embraces risk, uncertainty and real challenge – even real danger – as essential ingredients of a rounded childhood.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A Youth Rights Perspective on Brown v. EMA</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/6/a-youth-rights-perspective-on-brown-v-ema</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A very good analysis all around of the Supreme Court’s decision by the National Youth Rights Association, but this bit especially stuck out:</p>








<blockquote>Another key issue that is pervasive in all of the opinions is the role of parents. Parental rights—the right of parents to raise their children as they please free from interference from the state—is an issue that comes up frequently in discussions for the legal rights of minors. The California law at issue provides explicitly that parents (and aunts, uncles, grandparents, and legal guardians) can purchase or rent violent video games for their children. This is all that Justice Thomas needed to conclude that the law was constitutional. He drew on the historical record, starting with New England Puritan’s treatment of children, noting that in the 1800s parents would regulate what books their children would read and that parents could force their children to work for whomever they pleased (and parents could steal their children’s wages), and observing the strict degree of control Thomas Jefferson exerted on his daughters’ lives (via regular letters) to conclude that the framers of the constitution could not have believed that children have an independent right to be spoken to. Under Thomas’s view (as noted by Scalia), it would be constitutional to pass laws requiring parental permission to attend church, to attend political rallies, or to do just about anything.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fraser Speirs: 'How the iPad Wants to Be Used'</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/1/fraser-speirs-how-the-ipad-wants-to-be-used</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last autumn, a small school in Scotland abandoned classroom computers almost entirely – leaving behind the&nbsp;aging notion of 'the school IT lab' along with them.</p><p>Instead, each child in the school was given an iPad – and since then, the move has transformed the ways the students and teachers integrate technology into classroom learning within the school. Fraser Speirs, the IT guy and technology teacher at the school who was the driving force behind the change, did the world an excellent deed by documenting the entire process: from the small, quirky technical decisions they faced implementing the change to the giant shifts in ideology and thinking about technology that the adults at the school experienced. (Of course needless to say, the kids themselves didn’t have any problem whatsoever adapting to the change.)</p><p>It’s a great series, very honest and self-reflective – a perfect way to understand the potential for well-designed technology within education while recognizing the nuance and challenge of "doing it right."</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Playtime's Not Over Yet</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/3/playtimes-not-over-yet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, David Elkind wrote an editorial for the New York Times <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/2010/03/27/at-schools-playtime-is-over">offering his perspective</a> on the recent trend for schools to hire “play coaches” as a way to encourage children to play at recess.</p>

<p>At the end of his editorial, though, Elkind ended with this declaration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>￼We have to adapt to childhood as it is today, not as we knew it or would like it to be. The question isn’t whether recess coaches are good or bad — they seem to be with us to stay — but whether they help students form the age-old bonds of childhood. To the extent that the coaches focus on play, give children freedom of choice about what they want to do, and stay out of the way as much as possible, they are likely a good influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One must wonder, is this somehow a signal of defeat? From a man who’s spent his life arguing for free, child-led play?</p>

<p>Mike Lanza counters Elkind, arguing that “adaptation” simply isn’t the right answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems to me that Elkind is giving up, appeasing the adults who have been fighting for decades to dominate children’s lives under all sorts of banners like “safety,” “children’s fitness,” “education,” and “moral development.” I don’t think Elkind sympathizes with these folks, but he’s joining with them because he’s given up on trying to beat them.</p>
  
  <p>In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made a similar gesture to Adolph Hitler when he appeased Nazi Germany, acquiescing to their takeover of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia in return for Hitler’s worthless promise to stay out of Poland.</p>
  
  <p>Now, of course, no one, including me, would put recess coaches or anyone else who wants to exert more control over children’s lives on a moral plane anywhere near the Nazis. These people have a sincere and valid concern for the welfare of children, and they are doing what they believe is best for them.
  However, they believe that children need to be under more adult control to develop best. Advocates of “free play” or “unstructured play”* like myself believe that children need to be under less adult control. This is a fundamental disagreement. The stakes are extremely high. The quality of lives of our children today, the course of their future lives, and ultimately, the future of our civilization rests on this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll leave you to read the rest of Lanza's piece for yourself, but don’t miss it. It’s an eloquent manifesto-of-sorts to free play, and a great encouragement and reminder for the free play advocates in the trenches to stay the course. There’s too much at stake; too much to lose to give up now. As Mike argues, “This is no time for appeasement.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Really Bad Advice: 'Have School on Saturdays So We Can Compete With China'</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/3/really-bad-advice-have-school-on-saturdays-so-we-can-compete-with-china</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former assistant education secretary Chester E. Finn Jr. offers some really bad advice in the Wall Street Journal about how we could improve the American education system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the face of budget shortfalls, school districts in many parts of the United States today are moving toward four-day weeks. This is despite evidence that longer school weeks and years can improve academic performance. Schoolchildren in China attend school 41 days a year more than most young Americans —and receive 30% more hours of instruction. Schools in Singapore operate 40 weeks a year. Saturday classes are the norm in Korea and other Asian countries—and Japanese authorities are having second thoughts about their 1998 decision to cease Saturday-morning instruction. This additional time spent learning is one big reason that youngsters from many Asian nations routinely out-score their American counterparts on international tests of science and math. [...]</p>
  
  <p>[N]early every young American needs to learn more than most are learning today, both for the sake of their own prospects and on behalf of the nation’s competitiveness in a shrinking, dog- eat-dog world. Yes, it will disrupt everything from school-bus schedules to family vacations. Yes, it will carry some costs, at least until we eke offsetting savings from the technology-in- education revolution. But even Aristotle might conclude that this is a price worth paying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, Finn Jr. has fallen prey to so many misplaced and inherently flawed assumptions in his eloquently-assembled article, and I only wish I had the time to go through them all. A few key points: More of the same kind of education doesn’t get you better results. Our education system is flawed, but not for lack of time our kids spend in school – rather, that our schools are wasting our kids’ natural talent. Another thing: Schooling has never necessarily equaled learning, and a child’s future success isn’t necessarily dependent on their learning classical literature or many of the other things that we still use to compile our definition of “academic performance.” In truth, that phrase – that concept of academic performance – has arguably never been a good indicator of a child’s future success, either personally or economically (which is more often the concern in these Compare-U.S.- Education-to-Other-Countries games).</p>

<p>The simple paradox here, as educator <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/tags/ken-robinson">Sir Ken Robinson has written about before</a> and as even business people like <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> and <a href="http://www.danpink.com/">Dan Pink</a> understand, is this: in order to improve our education system and help America “compete”[1] in a global market, the emphasis <em>must</em> be on individual children and how they learn. We <em>have to</em> to stop fretting about the big and instead focus on the small. We have to help our schools be the best they can be for each individual student, enabling them to find out what they’re good at – what their “element” is, as Robinson writes – and then helping them develop that talent. Cookie cutter education doesn’t work anymore. We have to make small change first, with an individual child-centered education, and only then the changes ripple outward and we’ll begin to see a meaningful and real difference at the macro level.</p>

<p>Oddly, the only good point that I see Finn making is one that he interprets completely wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With continuing advances in hardware and software, the boundaries among “learning in school,” “learning in other settings” and “learning on your own” will gradually disappear, with potent implications for time spent learning, which need no longer be confined to the classroom hours stipulated in the teachers’ union (or custodians’ union) contract or the 180-day year prescribed in state law (and, in some jurisdictions, not allowed to start before Labor Day).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s absolutely true: there is no meaningful boundary between where learning occurs. If anything, though, that’s a reason to advocate for shortening the school days and years, not to increase them. Hopefully there will be a day when schools, as we know them, are gone forever – replaced with active learning that occurs out in the world, mediated and encouraged by mentors and a child’s community, and facilitated by local learning centers, libraries, personal technology and more.</p>

<p>[1] Whatever that means.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>‘Games Have Crept Out and They’re Going Everywhere’</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/3/games-have-crept-out-and-theyre-going-everywhere</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a presentation about the role of play in business and marketing, Carnegie Mellon University professor Jesse Schell notes the increasing popularity of gaming and 'gamification' – and the benefit it may yield for businesses. (An excellent example of this 'gamification' process – the process of turning ordinarily non-play based activities into playful games – is geocaching: "Because it’s cooler to go for a walk in the woods when there’s a treasure chest at the end.")</p>

      <title>A "Quick Fix" for America's Worst Schools</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/2/a-quick-fix-for-americas-worst-schools</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading TIME Magazine recently, and noticed that in a single piece, Gilbert Cruz <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1963754,00.html">has apparently solved all our nation's education problems</a>. There's an easy, quick solution to it all – if only we'd listen to him! There really is! (Call now while the offer's still good.)</p>

<p>While we'd all undoubtedly like to believe it, Cruz's miracle cure unfortunately seems to call for a few points of reality. Some thoughts.</p>

<p>First off, and perhaps to state the obvious, there is no “quick fix” for education – if there was, we would have found it long ago. Education is a continual process, not somebody’s toy model that just needs a bit of glue.</p>

<p>Second, though I’ve <a href="http://www.danielsaurus.com/?tag=charter%20schools">generally been supportive of charter schools</a> in the past, I believe they only really work when used as a structural mechanism of reform to allow for a broader range of educational philosophies and attract committed and focused, though perhaps non-traditional, teachers and school leadership. There are many great educators out there who nonetheless fail to make an impact in their current setting, because of the bureacratic and cultural constraints around them – and the offer of having more "breathing room" to focus on what really matters can bring out a lot of great talent and potential. That said, allowing the charter school "movement" to devolve into what is essentially a rhetorical substitute for the corporate takeover of education is simply bad mojo, and the opposite of what makes good charter schools (or schools in general) work. The use of charter schools can be a double-edged sword: they can encourage the exchange of ideas and philosophies if handled well, but can also be reduced and simplified into a placeholder for free-market ideologies. When that happens, it's a bad thing. Profit-driven education only benefits one party: the corporate profit-makers. If Arne Duncan's Department of Education, as well as the many charter school proponents out there, want to get serious about making sure charter schools work, they need to establish from the onset some very clear guidelines for what's involved and who can set one up – and remove profits from the equation completely. I also believe charters should be required to articulate a long-term manifesto of education: a well-developed, vibrant vision and philosophy of what school should be – preferably based on <a href="http://democraticeducation.org/index.php/democratic-education/">the best thinking</a> and <a href="http://www.edutopia.org">most current innovations and strategies in education</a> – as well as a 10-15 year outlook for achieving "success", and the necessary experience among school founders and teachers to make it all happen. </p>

<p>Another crucial element to ensure charter schools live up to their promise is re-considering how we measure a school's success to begin with. One frequent criticism of charter schools is that many often fail to deliver test scores and results that are on-par or better than what they were before, as public schools. For many schools, this criticism is warranted; they fail to truly differentiate themselves enough from other schools or their past incarnation, and when the only thing that's different about them is who the money goes to, they're inevitably bound to fail. However, this shouldn't stop us from questioning the methods we use to measure a charter school's performance. If we constantly complain that schools don't measure up, and nothing still seems to make a difference, isn't it time we ask whether the measurement tool itself is faulty? - A final thought: Why do we rely on the same criteria for measuring charter school performance as what we used before – yet not consider whether the measurement tool itself is faulty? No Child Left Behind helped entrench a culture within our public education of constant measuring a countless number of things – yet in the end those things may, or may not, be useful to children after they leave schools. The question of what matters, what's worth caring about, is important. How you respond may depend largely on your own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_education">philosophical view of education</a> – but there’s a valid point to be made that we will never be able to really quantify the true benefits of education or judge schools based solely on aggregated test scores. We need more flexibility in looking at education, and what it is and should be. Given the new age we're in, it's no longer enough to measure education today the same ways we've always measured education. To paraphrase Sir Ken Robinson: "We don't even know what the world will look like five years from now, much less in ten or fifteen years. And we're meant to be educating children for it?" </p>

<p>The bottom line is this: charter schools are only going to be as good as the thinking behind them. When we approach and utilize them for their potential to encourage and sustain a diverse exchange of pedagogical ideas, there's cause for hope; when they simply become about free-market capitalism and a race to see which corporate-run school board has the most efficient assembly line to meet yesterday's demands, however, there is none. </p>

<p>For all the talk – good and bad – about charter schools, though, most of it is diversionary. If we truly want to get serious about education reform, the first question – and possibly the only question – that should dominate our efforts has to be this one: What is education really about?</p>

<p>The structural mechanisms by which we enact education reform matter far less than the philosophy that drives it. For instance, public education in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sweden">Sweden</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands">Netherlands</a> both support and utilize partial voucher-based systems – to a high degree of success, ranking consistently high in global education rankings as well as seeming to fulfil their countries' own educational needs. Yet the only reason both countries have had success with such alternate structures is because the expectations and conceptions of education their citizens hold are radically different from our own, here in America. Tests are a rare thing for children, and they aren't emphasized when they are administered; parents, educators, and the culture at large regard children's learning as self-generated, and their engagement in a topic helps drive the curriculum; schools also strongly encourage and support children's active participation in society – and there is a great trust in children themselves, as well as teachers. Sweden and the Netherlands are able to experiment with their educational structures, in other words, because they have such a strong culture of support for children and education already – not the frenzied, results-driven madness that characterizes much of what we have in the United States.</p>

<p>In the end, it's not enough to try to "fix" education simply by implementing a few tweaks in how it's structured and the ways we pay for it. Changing education so that it benefits children will require a fundamental shift in the way we think of education, and our philosophies about children and learning. Further, this revolution needs to happen across our society and culture: as long as most Americans imagine education in the same way its always been, change will only ever be small and gradual. It's a tough slog either way – even while charter schools may offer the opportunity for a "fresh start" in many communities, and can serve as different examples that gradually influence the more popular conception of education in America. Until that kind of culture change happens en masse, though, we're just spinning our wheels with all of these "quick-and-easy" solutions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Common Ground on Abortion</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/common-ground-on-abortion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his regular column for the Washington Post, E.J. Dionne recently wrote about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-%20dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051701773.html">a recent speech President Barack Obama gave</a>&nbsp;at the University of Notre Dame – a speech that specifically and meaningfully addressed the topic of abortion. Dionne reflects:<br></p><blockquote><p>￼Facing down protesters who didn’t want him at Notre Dame, President Obama fought back not with harsh words but with the most devastating weapons in his political arsenal: a call for “open hearts,” “open minds,” “fair-minded words” and a search for “common ground.”</p><p>There were many messages sent from South Bend. Obama’s opponents seek to reignite the culture wars. He doesn’t. They would reduce religious faith to a narrow set of issues. He refused to join them. They often see theological arguments as leading to certainty. He opted for humility.</p></blockquote><p>Too often, the topic of abortion in America is treated as a battle.</p><p>Many of my friends know my stance on this. It’s something I can get pretty passionate about – not because I hold strongly to any one position that I feel is right, but because of how poorly I feel people understand the statistical and sociological realities of abortion. It shocks me – disgusts me, even – how quickly these realities about abortion can be oversimplified or dwarfed by dogma. But when we finally face the realities of abortion, we must confront these statistics:</p><ol><li>Making abortion illegal&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.pdf">has no impact on the number of abortions performed</a>. In fact, the countries with the lowest rates of abortion also have the most open and supportive laws regarding abortion.</li><li>A shocking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.pdf">75% of abortions are driven primarily by economic reasons</a>&nbsp;– simply, women donʼt feel they can financially afford to raise a child or will have the necessary support to do so.</li><li>Finally,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.catholicsinalliance.org/files/CACG_Final.pdf">social and economic supports do more to reduce abortion rates</a>&nbsp;than any judicial or legislative efforts. In order to see abortion go away (as much as it can), we need to see the war as one not against abortion, but a war against poverty.</li></ol><p>Morality of abortion aside, these are the facts. This is the statistic reality we all face with abortion – and this reality does not change based on your personal disposition, values or political orientation.</p><p>The American Church needs to recognize this, and understand that there can be many ways to deal with this reality. We need to realize that President Obama’s and the Democratic Party's longstanding commitment, for instance, to providing social and economic supports for the poorest among us might indeed make a greater difference in reducing the rate of abortions than the Church's current efforts, of abstinence-only education, legal maneuvering, and defunding insurance coverage for abortion procedures. Demonizing those who disagree doesn’t change the reality, nor does it bring us closer to working out a real solution to America's high abortion rates.</p><p>We need to seek a conciliatory center, one that’s good for all of us – and especially for the women and families facing circumstances which may lead them to choose an abortion. This is what we&nbsp;<em>need</em>. Instead, most “pro life” (and, equally, “pro choice”) efforts have ignored these basic facts, and their advocates have allowed the conversation to devolve into a culture war.</p><p>What we instead need to seek is a common ground between these two ultimately insufficient labels. We need to seek, as Notre Dame president Reverend John I. Jenkins said, a place of conciliatory dialogue where we can approach each other and the matter at hand “with love and a generous spirit.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Should Teachers Carry Guns?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/should-teachers-carry-guns</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a week has gone by and the counter-gun control argument has already tossed courtesy aside and begun blaming everything <em>but</em> the ready availability of guns for the Sandy Hook shooting. First, mental health – and those who work in mental health services – took the rap; it's not guns, it's just crazy people who kill. Then, out came the video game excuse, as National Rifle Association spokesman Wayne LaPierre – who apparently still lives in the 1990s – took to a news conference <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/us/nra-calls-for-armed-guards-at-schools.html?&amp;pagewanted=all">to blame</a></p>

<p>I'm particularly struck by this argument from Charlotte Allen at </p>

<p>Responding to a ludicrous charge by the <em><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/335996/newtown-answers-nro-symposium">National Review</a></em> that the Sandy Hook shooting was allowed to happen because "there were no men around in the school [...] creating a 'feminized setting' in which 'helpless passivity is the norm'" (never mind how preposterous all of that is), New Yorker writer Amy Davidson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the mother of a twelve-year-old who might be described as husky, or at least big for his age, I do teach him that he has an extra responsibility to, for example, stand up for littler kids who are bullied—to never be a bystander. But I greatly resent the idea that he should throw himself in front of a bullet because a grown congressman isn’t brave enough to throw an N.R.A. lobbyist out of his office.</p>

      <title>The Enduring Popularity of LEGO (and a Long Rant About Other Things)</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/the-enduring-popularity-of-lego-and-a-long-rant-about-other-things</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing for NPR's Planet Money blog, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/13/167055503/why-legos-are-so-expensive-and-so-popular">Chana Joffe-Walt takes a look</a> at why LEGO sets are so expensive – and yet have remained so popular over the years. It's a solid piece, as Joffe-Walt also shares from an interview with David Robertson, author of the forthcoming book <em>Brick by Brick: How LEGO Reinvented its Innovation System and Conquered the Toy Industry</em>. (You do have to ignore the article's egregious violations of the correct pluralization of LEGO, though. Hint: <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/10839/legos-not-lego">it's <em>not</em> "Legos"</a>.) </p>

<p>This passage in particular, though, stuck out at me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Star Wars blocks were wildly successful. So Lego kept going — it licensed Indiana Jones, Winnie the Pooh, Toy Story and Harry Potter.</p>
  
  <p>Sales of these products have been huge for Lego. More important, the experience has taught the company that what kids wanted to do with the blocks was tell stories. Lego makes or licenses the stories they want to tell.</p>
  
  <p>And kids know the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thast's it. Those four short sentences manage to capture so many great things so perfectly. They nail what LEGO is about. They also nail the enduring allure of Star Wars. But they also nail something more fundamental about our understanding of childhood and the role of children's toys.</p>

<h2 id="yeahyeahsoyourkidplayswithuttercrap">Yeah, yeah, so your kid plays with utter crap</h2>

<p>As adults, we often find ourselves bemoaning "the commercialization of childhood." We wish – all too readily – that children would just play with simpler and less expensive toys, and exchange the "overstimulation" of videogames for a Normal Rockwell pace of life. It's just become accepted to assume that children's creativity and imagination are associated with children's toys that are more "open-ended," nondescript, non-commercial, and that anything else is crap: maybe not that harmful for kids, but certainly not that good for them either. Especially if it <a href="http://commercialfreechildhood.org/sites/default/files/levin_childrensrights.pdf">has a brand, is Justin Bieber, or wears pretend gogo boots</a>. When we walk down the toy aisle, a good parent's instinct is to seek out the "educational toys" and books – and to avoid anything that looks too cheap, too derived from popular culture or media, or just too out of our comfort zone.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the adult culture surrounding the American middle class childhood experience today is about one basic task: determining what things are "good" for children and what things are "bad" for children, and then maximizing the good and minimizing the bad.</p>

<p>The "good bad good bad!" agenda is widespread – and so seemingly innocuous that we aren't often conscious of our participation in it. Yet it's there. I see it every day in the expectations of the (very bright) young undergraduate students I work with, many of whom at least initially claim that they want to with kids so that they can "save childhood" from an unrelenting barrage of popular culture, video games, and media. (I talk them out of that misconception pretty quickly.) It's also there in the social pressure parents extend to each other: the disapproving looks at the playground suggestively questioning why you aren't giving your child organic juice instead of Kool-Aid. It's there in the "10 ways to [improve] your child!" lists and the fortune cookie wisdom within parenting magazines and talk shows, and there in the curriculum taught to every future teacher of America within their child development classes, and in the constant, endless bemoaning of society expressed within a million slightly-reworded versions of the same damn newspaper op-ed.</p>

<p>It's also there in the questions we ask, both of children and of ourselves. Why do kids need Angry Birds when they can go outside and see real birds? Why must my child spend so many countless hours playing this stupid Pirates of the Carribean video game when they could just read "Treasure Island"? Why do kids even need action figures and Barbie dolls, when they could just – you know – make one with a stick or something?</p>

<p>We constantly, implicitly prioritize the "stuff" of childhood, even when we're not aware of it. Outdoors are better than indoors. It's better to live in the suburbs than the city. Books are better than TV and video games, and old books are better than new books. (Especially those horrible new, sex-ridden YA ones.) If the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew were good enough for us, they should be plenty good for kids these days. </p>

<p>Lori Pickert wrote something similar to this in 2009, explaining why she didn't ever worry about her children's screen time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a billboard in my town that makes me grind my teeth into dust. It shows a kid’s hands holding, on the left, a video-game controller and, on the right, a turtle. Then it says something along the lines of “unplug”.</p>
  
  <p>I was ranting about it the other day and one of my sons rolled his eyes (nicely) and said, “Mooooom, they’re just telling people to, you know, go outside more.” And yes, I get that. But they are doing it in a way that makes me crazy.</p>
  
  <p>The whole either/or mentality is what gets to me. By positing the game controller against the turtle, the message is “video games: bad, playing outside: good.” Why isn’t this a good way to get kids outdoors? Because if they reject the left side of that equation, they may automatically reject the right side. This kind of shaming argument runs a serious risk of turning kids off the outdoors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She labels this argument, in short, <a href="http://project-based-homeschooling.com/camp-creek-blog/defense-reading-which-should-need-no-defense">the "books are broccoli" approach</a>. As Lori describes: "We are sending all kinds of subtle, between-the-lines messages about what’s broccoli and what’s candy." Every day. </p>

<p>And you know what it's really about? Control. Adults want to control kids. They want them to get into Harvard, or they want them to score the winning touchdown in their football team. They want them to experience the same kind of childhood as they remember. One of my (very bright) students shared this quote with me recently: "Children are not coloring books. You can't simply fill them in with all your favorite colors."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2012/12/yes-20-somethings-are-taking-longer-to-grow-upbut-why-hope-reese-the-atlantic</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writer Hope Reese's reminsces within The Atlantic about "why 20-somethings are taking longer to grow up" has me positively thrilled. I'm clearly not alone in my detest of the quasi-intellectual, rambling, pseudo-scientific "Kids these Days!" critiques of the "Millenial" generation; looking closely at the social rhetoric and discourses about millenials, Reese tears to shreds one popular book entitled <em>Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn't even begin to address the real issue at hand -- which is that the concept of "adulthood" is slippery, and the old benchmarks don't necessarily apply anymore. The idea of home ownership feels absurdly out of reach to many of us. How could we think about investing in a house when we're facing decades of paying off student loans? But while the authors acknowledge that debt is one largest hurdles confronting Millennials, they don't explore how debt affects our life choices, relationships, marriage, and careers. In all of those areas, they deem the Millennials' experience "same as it ever was."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rhetorically, much of the criticism </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>'How Do We Help Kids Make Better Choices? Let Them Practice'</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/how-do-we-help-kids-make-better-choices-let-them-practice-edutopia</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great, research-based advice from Matt Levinson, at Edutopia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decision-making grows stronger each time a child has to figure out a tricky situation on his or her own -- making a poor decision, facing natural consequences for the poor decision, and then reliving a similar situation again, with a new set of choices gathered from the first unsuccessful experience. For some kids, it may take several of these unsuccessful experiences before they figure out the successful framework to make different and more positive choices to arrive at a more fulfilling conclusion that propels them in the right direction.</p>
  
  <p>These situations crop up each and every day at school, at recess, at lunch, on the bus, in extracurricular activities, and in email and other forms of electronic media. There is no way for adults to be present in each and every one of these settings, and we should not be there for every interaction, because if we are, kids will never have the room to gain those experiences they need for their healthy development. [...]</p>
  
  <p>We need to remind ourselves that, as parents and educators, we need the practice of letting go, stepping back, and being present when we need to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's that last part – being present when we need to be, and letting go when we don't – that I think truly makes the difference. Timing is everything. Being attuned</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why Aren't Children Fit Anymore?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/why-arent-children-fit-anymore</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>http://rethinkingchildhood.com/2012/01/13/good-childhood/</p>

<p>Gretchen Reynolds, writing for the New York Times, points to a new research review published last week that examined the effectiveness of special physical fitness programs for children:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In each case, the investigators had expected that the programs would increase the children’s overall daily physical activity.</p>
  
  <p>That didn’t happen, as the review’s authors found when they carefully parsed outcomes. The American students, for instance, increased their overall daily physical activity by about five minutes per day. But only during the first few weeks of the program; by the end, their overall daily physical activity had returned to about where it had been before the program began. The wee Scottish participants actually became less physically active over all on the days when they had the 30-minute play sessions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To someone who spends time with kids and thinks critically about their lives, I have to say this would seem obvious: kids don't benefit from these programs because they're boring. You'd need to put "play sessions" up above in very clear air-quotes, because really, they're anything but; they're patronizing and heavy-handed, and almost exclusively guided by adults. What kid wants to spend even <em>more</em> time during their day being told what to do by an adult – especially when that cuts into what would otherwise be playtime with friends (as Reynolds appropriately points out)?</p>

<p>Simply stated, most of these interventions to address children's physical fitness do very little to address the thing that's actually much more important: the culture and social conditions around children's lives. These play a much bigger role in determining fitness levels than just children's own attitudes about fitness. We so often treat children's physical inactivity as an isolated problem – and one that's mostly their fault – when the reality is really the exact opposite.</p>

<p><strong>The first lesson here is that family culture matters.</strong> The amount of a child's levels of physical activity <a href="http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/8/1/17">correlates very closely</a> with that of their parents: active kids tend to have active parents. That might seem obvious, but in practice it's hardly ever considered within intervention efforts. It's not a completely causal relationship – you can have very active kids from very inactive families, and inactive kids from very active families – but it is a crucial bellwether indicator of the social and physical conditions around children's lives that encourage physical activity. If you're a kid and all you ever see your parents do is bum around on the couch after work – and they hardly ever play or step foot outside (save to walk to the minivan) – you're very likely to follow suit. In fact, it'd be hard not to. Which leads us to the second lesson.</p>

<p><strong>The other part of this reality is that children face incredible social and physical barriers to play and physical activity.</strong>  In almost all cases, children really do lack the time, space, and freedom to play. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> Children's schedules have been filled with organized sports, activities, and other obligations, not to mention homework – all of which drastically eat into the amount of time they have that's completely their own.</li>
<li><strong>Space:</strong> How often do you see an interesting backyard? A real one, with messy, open-ended materials like treehouses and lumber, perhaps some sand, water, and fire – all freely available for kids to use when they want and for what they want? At best, most backyards might have a swingset designed for six-year-olds and maybe a trampoline. That might suffice for a while, but we all need new stimulation every now and then – and we like it even more when we have some control over our environment, and know : when we can play big and build messy, and when we know that it'll always be there for us to come back to.</li>
</ul>

<p>When all of their time obligations are said and done, what 
* Freedom:</p>

<p>amount of time when they're in control of their lives.</p>

<p>There's a reason that after-school programs</p>

<p>with inactive parents are also much more likely to have more barriers to play and physical activity; parents might</p>

<p>parents might not appreciate its value, they might not provide regular opportunities for it in children's environments and schedules, and they might not really foster a family culture</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Being an Atelierista in a Reggio Inspired School</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/being-an-atelierista-in-a-reggio-inspired-school</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can often be confusing what kind of a role the 'Atelierista', or Art Studio teacher, has within a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia_approach">Reggio Emilia-inspired</a> school – and just how much of it does or should involve 'direct instruction'. On the one hand, the arts are so integrally regarded in the approach as languages of exploration and expression for children – so it makes sense that the proficiency children have in these different art mediums is a vital consideration for teachers. Yet within the Reggio 'way', it is so often the children's own inquiries, play, and interests that guide and direct the classroom's emergent curriculum – the approach is, in simple terms, the antithesis of 'direct', teacher-driven instruction. How can proficiency be pursued, while respecting children as the center of the school?</p>

<p>Atelierista Anna provides a wonderful consideaiton of this.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Child labor is, without a doubt, an explosive and sensational topic for the press to cover.

Often lax supervision by teachers, possible expoitation for the teachers' own gain. Bottom line: is the final benefit here supposed to be for the students themselves – is this a learning experience, where they aren't held to the same expectations or standards – or the adults?

      <title>Why Seth MacFarlane and The Onion's Jokes About Quvenzhané Wallis Are So Gross | ThinkProgress</title>
      <link>/blog/null</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright, yes. Sure. It may be possible to disregarded the joke from Seth MacFarlane as, well, a joke from Seth MacFarlane.
